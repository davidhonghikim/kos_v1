# KOS v1 Development Status

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Amauta Wearable AI Node System (KOS v1)  
**Current Phase**: Active Development  
**AI Assistant**: Various AI models providing development support  
**KOS Agent Status**: Not yet implemented

## What This Project Is

The Amauta Wearable AI Node System is a comprehensive, production-grade wearable AI platform that serves as the foundation for future KOS (Knowledge Operating System) agent development. It features:

- **Complete 13-Class Node System**: Culturally-grounded AI infrastructure
- **Medical-Grade Features**: DICOM support, health monitoring, HIPAA compliance
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Coordinated AI system with LLM integration
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom functionality
- **Security Framework**: OAuth2, WebAuthN, RBAC, encrypted vault
- **Containerized Deployment**: Full Docker Compose orchestration

## What This Project Is NOT

- **A KOS Agent**: The KOS agent system is not yet implemented
- **Fully Autonomous**: Requires human oversight and decision-making
- **Production Ready**: Currently in active development phase
- **Self-Operating**: Requires external AI assistance for development

## AI Assistant Role

**Current AI Assistants**: Various AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)  
**Role**: Development support and code generation  
**Responsibilities**:
- Code review and optimization
- Bug identification and fixes
- Architecture guidance
- Documentation updates
- Testing assistance
- Deployment support

**Limitations**:
- No KOS agents (not yet implemented)
- Require human oversight
- Cannot operate autonomously
- Limited to development assistance

## Development Workflow

1. **Human Developer**: Defines requirements and goals
2. **AI Assistant**: Provides code, suggestions, and implementation
3. **Human Review**: Validates and approves changes
4. **Testing**: Automated and manual testing
5. **Deployment**: Human-controlled deployment process

## Future KOS Agent Development

The KOS agent system will be built on top of this foundation and will include:

- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-managing capabilities
- **Learning Systems**: Adaptive behavior and improvement
- **Decision Making**: Autonomous decision processes
- **Self-Monitoring**: Health and performance monitoring
- **Federation**: Multi-agent coordination

## Contributing

When contributing to this project:

1. **Understand the Scope**: This is a foundation project, not a complete KOS agent
2. **Follow Standards**: Use established coding and documentation standards
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all changes are properly tested
4. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Seek Review**: Get human review for significant changes

## Support and Communication

- **Development Issues**: GitHub Issues
- **Documentation**: See `/docs` directory
- **AI Assistants**: Various AI models for development support
- **Human Oversight**: Required for all major decisions
