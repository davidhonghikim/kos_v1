## Project Overview

The KOS v1 Knowledge Library Framework is a comprehensive, universal knowledge management and agent orchestration ecosystem that serves as the foundation for living, breathing digital societies. It features:

- **Complete 13-Class Node System**: Foundation, governance, elder, and core tiers
- **Transformer-Class Resident System**: Spark identity, Cortex runtime, Vault memory
- **Medical-Grade Features**: DICOM support, health monitoring, HIPAA compliance
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Coordinated AI agents with ethical frameworks
- **Plugin System**: Extensible capabilities and modular design
- **Security Framework**: OAuth2, WebAuthN, encrypted vault, RBAC

## Current Development Phase
