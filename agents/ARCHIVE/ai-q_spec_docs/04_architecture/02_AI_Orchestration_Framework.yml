  title: '1. Overview: AI as Orchestrator'
  type: section
  content: "The core kOS architecture shall focus on providing raw capabilities and\
    \ standardized interfaces, while AI agents take on the responsibility of composing\
    \ and orchestrating those capabilities to achieve specific goals. \n\nTo achieve\
    \ this, kOS is implemented as a **monorepo framework**, not a static application.\
    \ This provides a clear separation between the reusable core libraries and the\
    \ applications that consume them.\n\n- **Core Framework (`@griot/core`, etc.):**\
    \ Foundational packages located in `packages/` provide the KLF protocol, base\
    \ node functionality, and other essential building blocks.\n- **Applications (`Starseed\
    \ Node`, etc.):** Runnable nodes located in `apps/` consume the framework to perform\
    \ specialized tasks.\n\nAn AI-driven orchestration layer will dynamically select\
    \ and compose the optimal \"tools\" (node functionalities) to fulfill a user's\
    \ request."

- level: 3
  title: 2.1. Simplified Node Architecture
  type: section
  content: 'Application-specific logic will be removed from individual nodes. The
    core functionality becomes more generic and modular.


    -   **Griot:** Serves as the central library host, manages deployments, and monitors
    the health of deployed services. It orchestrates updates and checks with the central
    orchestration engine.

    -   **Tohunga:** Validates, cleans, structures, and shares data from various sources
    via standardized connectors. Its validation functions are designed to work with
    any compatible data source.

    -   **Other Nodes:** The principle of generic, modular functionality applies to
    all other node classes.'
- level: 3
  title: 2.2. AI Agent as Planner & Executor
  type: section
  content: '1.  A requesting entity submits a high-level goal or intent to the orchestrator.

    2.  The orchestrator''s AI agent analyzes the objective.

    3.  The agent queries the ecosystem to discover available nodes and their capabilities
    (Roles).

    4.  It generates a plan and the necessary code implementation to fulfill the request.

    5.  It deploys the solution into the ecosystem.

    6.  The agent uses a continuous feedback loop from the system to learn and improve
    the efficiency and quality of its future plans.'

  title: 3. Core Implementation Requirements
  type: section
  content: ''
- level: 3
  title: 3.1. KLF for Universal Service Invocation
  type: section
  content: 'The Kind Link Framework (KLF) protocol must be revised to support **dynamic
    service discovery and invocation**.

    - A node must be able to query the network for another node that meets specific
    capability criteria.

    - It must then be able to invoke its functions through a standardized interface.

    - All nodes must share a common set of base KLF calls and a foundational functional
    framework to simplify communication and orchestration.'
- level: 3
  title: 3.2. Abstract Orchestration Engine
  type: section
  content: 'A dedicated component, likely residing within Griot or a new "Orchestrator"
    node, will be responsible for:

    -   Analyzing incoming requests.

    -   Decomposing them into sub-tasks.

    -   Identifying the node capabilities required to accomplish each sub-task.'
- level: 3
  title: 3.3. AI-Powered Tool Selection & Composition
  type: section
  content: 'An AI agent must be implemented for selecting the optimal nodes/capabilities
    for each task. It will consider factors such as:

    -   **Capabilities:** Based on the `RoleManifest` of each node.

    -   **Performance:** Based on real-time and historical monitoring data.

    -   **Trust & Reputation:** Based on a distributed reputation system.

    -   **Cultural Affinity:** If relevant to the nature of the task.'
- level: 3
  title: 3.4. Secure Execution & Monitoring
  type: section
  content: '-   A secure execution environment (e.g., sandboxing, containerization)
    is mandatory for running composed workflows.

    -   The system must monitor the execution of all workflows and collect metrics
    to feed the AI''s learning loop.'
- level: 3
  title: 3.5. AI Feedback & Learning
  type: section
  content: '-   Reinforcement learning or other appropriate ML techniques should be
    used to train the AI agent to make better orchestration decisions over time.

    -   A mechanism for incorporating human feedback is required to correct mistakes
    and improve the quality of outcomes.'
- level: 2
  title: 4. Code Design & Quality Mandates
  type: section
  content: "1.  **RoleManifest:** A `RoleManifest.json` or similar file must be a\
    \ standard component for every node, automatically populated at startup. This\
    \ manifest declares the node's capabilities to the network.\n2.  **Interface Compliance:**\
    \ Strict interface compliance is a high-priority requirement for all base libraries\
    \ and node components.\n3.  **Security:** The highest level of security must be\
    \ implemented, including rigorous code analysis, build-time testing, and sandboxing\
    \ to prevent the introduction of malicious code or backdoors.\n4.  **Orchestration\
    \ Function:** A single, unified function must exist within the kOS core to manage\
    \ the end-to-end process of:\n    -   a. Pulling workflow code.\n    -   b. Validating\
    \ its origin and safety.\n    -   c. Installing it.\n    -   d. Performing security\
    \ and health checks.\n    -   e. Executing the workflow."

  title: 5. Agent Development Scope
  type: section
  content: 'Agents working on this system are **not responsible for**:

    -   Creating highly specialized, domain-specific machine learning models.

    -   Defining the *specific* solutions to end-user requests.


    The focus is on building the foundational, generic pieces of this orchestration
    framework. All development efforts should be directed toward these components
    to maximize their function and flexibility.'
