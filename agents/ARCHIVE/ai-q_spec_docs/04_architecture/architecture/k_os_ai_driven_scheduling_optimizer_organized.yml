# kOS AI-Driven Scheduling Optimizer

## Overview
The **kOS AI-Driven Scheduling Optimizer (ADSO)** introduces adaptive, machine learning-powered scheduling capabilities to the kOS Multi-Agent Orchestrator. It enhances task allocation, resource balancing, ethics-risk scoring, and Node Class awareness by learning from historical agent performance, system load patterns, and ethical risk data.
