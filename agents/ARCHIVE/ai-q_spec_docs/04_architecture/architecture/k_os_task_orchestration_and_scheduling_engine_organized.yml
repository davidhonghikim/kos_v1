# kOS Task Orchestration and Scheduling Engine

## Overview
The **kOS Task Orchestration and Scheduling Engine (TOSE)** serves as the central workload coordinator within each kOS node. It manages task prioritization, resource allocation, execution timing, and inter-agent workload distribution.

TOSE ensures optimal utilization of computational resources while maintaining ethical compliance and operational efficiency across the kOS ecosystem.

---

## 1. Functional Architecture

### 1.1 Core Components
- **Task Queue Manager**
- **Execution Scheduler**
- **Resource Allocator**
- **Ethical Compliance Filter (GEIG Hook)**
- **Load Balancer**
- **Task State Tracker**

### 1.2 Scheduling Models Supported
- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**
- **Deadline-Aware Scheduling**
- **Round-Robin for Low-Priority Agents**
- **Custom User-Defined Policies**

---

## 2. Task Lifecycle

### 2.1 Task Submission
- Tasks are submitted by agents, external APIs, or user interfaces.
- Every task request passes through GEIG for ethical and security validation.

### 2.2 Queue Insertion
- Tasks are inserted into appropriate queues based on priority and task type.
- Optional tagging for batch processing or swarm coordination.

### 2.3 Scheduling and Resource Matching
- Tasks are scheduled based on:
  - Available CPU, memory, network I/O.
  - Node load balancing metrics.
  - Agent availability and capability matches.

### 2.4 Execution Phase
- Task is handed off to the assigned agent or microservice.
- Execution monitored for health, timing, and outcome.

### 2.5 Post-Execution Handling
- Results are stored or forwarded as needed.
- Task status updated in the **Task State Tracker**.
- Success/failure outcomes logged.

---

## 3. Resource Management

- **Dynamic Resource Scaling:**
  - Real-time allocation adjustments based on changing loads.

- **Failover Handling:**
  - If an agent crashes mid-task, TOSE automatically re-queues or migrates the task.

- **Deadlock Prevention:**
  - Task locking and cycle detection mechanisms.

---

## 4. Ethical and Security Enforcement

- All tasks must pass GEIG approval pre-execution.
- Tasks exceeding predefined resource quotas are automatically throttled or denied.
- High-risk tasks may require multi-node consensus before execution.

---

## 5. Task Metadata Schema

Each task includes:
- Unique Task ID
- Originating Agent ID
- Target Resource or Node
- Task Type
- Priority Level
- Deadline (optional)
- Ethical Risk Score (from GEIG)
- Current State (Pending, Running, Completed, Failed, Blocked)

---

## 6. API Endpoints

- `/tose/task/submit`
- `/tose/task/status/{task_id}`
- `/tose/task/cancel/{task_id}`
- `/tose/resource/metrics`
- `/tose/queue/status`
- `/tose/scheduler/config`

---

## 7. Load Balancing Algorithms

- **Static Weighting**
- **Dynamic Load Feedback Loops**
- **Predictive Scheduling (Optional AI Module)**
- **Swarm-Aware Task Splitting**

---

## 8. Inter-Agent Task Distribution

- Supports splitting large tasks across multiple agents.
- Optional **Swarm Consensus Mode** for distributed result aggregation.
- Backpressure signaling to avoid overload.

---

## 9. Monitoring and Visualization

- Real-time dashboards (via kOS UI layer)
- API-driven reporting for external monitoring tools
- Historical execution logs with performance analytics

---

## 10. Failure and Retry Policies

- **Configurable Retry Limits**
- **Exponential Backoff Algorithms**
- **Escalation to Human Operator (via GEIG)** after repeated failures

---

## 11. Future Enhancements

- Predictive load balancing using machine learning models
- Temporal and Event-Driven Scheduling
- Integration with decentralized compute networks for overflow workloads
- Support for GPU and specialized hardware task offloading

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Task Orchestration and Scheduling Engine (TOSE)** forms the operational backbone of the entire kOS workload management system. It ensures that every task is ethically filtered, efficiently scheduled, and safely executed across all participating agents and nodes.
