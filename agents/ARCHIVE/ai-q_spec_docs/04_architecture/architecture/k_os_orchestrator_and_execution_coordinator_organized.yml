# kOS Orchestrator and Execution Coordinator

## Overview
The **kOS Orchestrator and Execution Coordinator (OEC)** is the master control layer responsible for high-level system flow management, distributed task orchestration, agent workload balancing, and multi-phase execution planning across the kOS ecosystem.

The OEC serves as the central nervous system that sequences, delegates, supervises, and audits complex task workflows that span multiple agents, nodes, and external systems.

---

## 1. Core Responsibilities

- Global execution plan generation
- Cross-agent task delegation
- Distributed process synchronization
- Multi-stage pipeline management
- System-wide execution state tracking
- Failure recovery coordination

---

## 2. Functional Architecture

### 2.1 Workflow Definition Module
- Accepts execution plans from agents, users, or external APIs
- Parses workflows into task trees and dependency graphs
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution flows

### 2.2 Agent Selection Engine
- Matches tasks with appropriate agents based on:
  - Capability manifests
  - Current load and availability
  - Proximity (network latency considerations)
  - Ethical suitability (via GEIG)

### 2.3 Execution Tracker
- Monitors task progress in real time
- Maintains state transitions (Pending → Running → Completed → Failed → Retried)
- Provides rollback and retry control mechanisms

### 2.4 Load Distribution Controller
- Dynamically balances workload across nodes and agents
- Supports throttling and queuing to prevent overloads
- Integrates with TOSE (Task Orchestration and Scheduling Engine) for scheduling coordination

---

## 3. Workflow Types Supported

- Single-agent atomic tasks
- Multi-agent parallelized workloads
- Sequential pipelines with stepwise dependencies
- Event-triggered reactive workflows
- Time-triggered scheduled tasks

---

## 4. Error Handling and Recovery

- Automatic task retry with configurable backoff
- Failure impact analysis before retries
- Escalation to human operators via GEIG for unresolved execution errors
- System-wide rollback for critical failure scenarios

---

## 5. API Endpoints

- `/oec/workflow/submit`
- `/oec/workflow/status/{workflow_id}`
- `/oec/task/assign`
- `/oec/task/state/{task_id}`
- `/oec/load/metrics`
- `/oec/recovery/trigger`

---

## 6. Telemetry and Reporting

- Execution flow visualization via kOS Dashboard
- Agent workload heatmaps
- Task latency and success rate statistics
- Anomaly detection in execution patterns

---

## 7. Ethical Execution Constraints

- GEIG validation for every workflow before execution
- Continuous ethical risk scoring during workflow runtime
- Real-time ethical checkpointing for long-running workflows

---

## 8. Advanced Features

- Predictive execution planning using AI models
- Cross-cluster workflow orchestration
- Custom user-defined workflow policies
- Dynamic workflow reconfiguration in-flight

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Orchestrator and Execution Coordinator (OEC)** ensures that every task, workflow, and system action in the kOS ecosystem happens in the right sequence, by the right agent, under the right conditions, and with full ethical and operational accountability.
