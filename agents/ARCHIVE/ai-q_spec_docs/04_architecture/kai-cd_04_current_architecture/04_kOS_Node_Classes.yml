  type: section
  content: 'The `kOS` ecosystem is composed of specialized, interoperable server nodes,
    each with a distinct role inspired by archetypes of community and knowledge. This
    document provides the canonical definition for each node class, outlining their
    core essence and key responsibilities. This serves as the master guide for understanding
    the architecture''s separation of concerns.
