  content: '**For AI Agents**: Complete agent orchestration architecture covering
    evolution from current service management to sophisticated agent mesh orchestration.
    Use this when implementing agent lifecycle management, planning multi-agent coordination,
    or understanding orchestration patterns. Critical foundation for all agent coordination
    work.


    **Implementation Notes**: Contains current service orchestration patterns and
    future comprehensive agent mesh with lifecycle management, security framework,
    and communication protocols. Includes working TypeScript interfaces and deployment
    patterns.

    **Quality Requirements**: Keep orchestration patterns and agent lifecycle management
    concepts accurate. Maintain synchronization with actual service management implementation.

    **Integration Points**: Foundation for agent coordination, links to service architecture,
    workflow management, and future distributed agent systems.

  title: Overview
  type: section
  content: The Agent Orchestration Architecture defines how autonomous agents are
    managed, coordinated, and executed across the Kai-CD to kOS evolution. This system
    provides the foundation for multi-agent workflows, distributed computing, and
    intelligent task delegation.

  title: Agent Lifecycle Management
  type: section
  content: 'The future kOS system implements comprehensive agent lifecycle orchestration
    with nine distinct stages:


    1. **Definition**: Developer creates manifest and capability profile

    2. **Registration**: Agent registered with system orchestrator

    3. **Activation**: Agent loaded into runtime and sandboxed

    4. **Handshake**: Agent advertises profile to registry

    5. **Execution**: Agent responds to task contracts

    6. **Upgrade**: Orchestrator triggers updates

    7. **Quarantine**: Misbehaving agents isolated

    8. **Termination**: Agent destroyed and memory cleared

    9. **Audit**: Final logs stored in audit trail'
