# Overview
overview: |
  This document outlines the integration of T.A.R.D.I.S. with blockchain tokenomics, creating a 
  neural architecture where AI skills are tokenized as Cogs (NFTs) and computation is powered by 
  Energon tokens. This creates a decentralized AI economy where every computation is a tokenized 
  transformer layer, and every persona trait is a DAO proposal.

# Core Components & Analogies
core_components:
  transformers_tf:
    cog: "TARDIS-Cog Tokens (NFTs) - Represents AI 'skills' or 'persona fragments'"
    energon: "TARDIS-Energon (Utility Token) - Powers computation/RAG queries"
    transformer_matrix: "Hybrid RAG Engine (Weaviate+Mongo+AI-Q) - The 'brain' processing inputs/outputs"
    spark: "Persona Soul (Ethical Kernel) - Moral/creative driver"

# Low-Level Architecture

## The Cog NFT System (Skill Tokens)
cog_nft_system:
  structure: "ERC-1155 Semi-Fungible Tokens"
  contract_example: |
    contract TARDISCog is ERC1155 {
        struct Cog {
            uint256 id;          // e.g., "QuantumMathV1"
            address minter;      // Creator (backend service or user)
            string metadataURI;  // IPFS link to skill specs
            uint256 energonCost; // Cost to execute this skill
        }
        mapping(uint256 => Cog) public cogs;
    }
  
  skill_registration:
    process: |
      1. A new tool (e.g., market_analyzer) mints a Cog NFT
      2. T.A.R.D.I.S. auto-detects new Cogs via smart contract events
    
    metadata_example: |
      metadataURI: ipfs://QmXy... (Contains:)
      {
        "skill": "sentiment_analysis",
        "input_format": "text",
        "output_format": "float[0..1]",
        "energon_cost": 10
      }

## Energon Token Flow (ERC-20)
energon_token_flow:
  utility:
    - "Pay for RAG queries (1 Energon = 10ms GPU time)"
    - "Stake for priority routing (Higher stake = lower latency)"
    - "Governance votes (e.g., upgrade T.A.R.D.I.S. core)"
  
  minting_rules:
    method: "Mined via PoUW (Proof of Useful Work)"
    validators_earn_by:
      - "Running RAG retrieval tasks (Weaviate queries)"
      - "Training persona fragments (AI-Q contributions)"
  
  burning_mechanics: |
    function executeSkill(uint256 cogId) external {
        require(energon.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cogs[cogId].energonCost);
        energon.burn(msg.sender, cogs[cogId].energonCost);
        _runSkill(cogId); // Calls backend
    }

# Neural Blockchain Synergy

## Transformer-Style Attention Routing
attention_routing:
  key_innovation: "Use tokenized attention heads where each Cog NFT bids Energon to prioritize its execution"
  
  implementation: |
    class TARDISLayer(nn.Module):
        def forward(self, x):
            # x = User query embedding
            cog_weights = [cog.bid for cog in active_cogs]  # Energon bids
            attention = softmax(cog_weights)                 # Bids → attention
            output = sum([cog(x)*w for cog,w in zip(cogs, attention)])
            return output
  
  result: "Higher Energon-staked skills dominate the 'attention' of the AI core"

## Cognitive Pipeline (Step-by-Step)
cognitive_pipeline:
  steps:
    - step: "User Query"
      example: "Analyze Tesla Q3 earnings with sentiment"
    
    - step: "Cog Auction"
      bidders:
        - "financial_analyzer bids 50 Energon"
        - "sentiment_detector bids 30 Energon"
        - "meme_economist bids 5 Energon (loses)"
    
    - step: "Execution"
      actions:
        - "RAG retrieves Tesla docs (cost: 20 Energon)"
        - "Skills run in attention-weighted order"
    
    - step: "Payment Flow"
      flow: |
        User --Energon--> Treasury
        Treasury --Rewards--> Validators
        Treasury --Burn--> Protocol

# Persona as a Tokenized DAO
persona_dao:
  concept: "Decentralized Autonomous Personality"
  features:
    - "Cog NFTs vote on persona traits (e.g., 'Increase sarcasm by 10%')"
    - "Staking Mechanism: Stake 1000 Energon to propose a persona change"
    - "Other Cog holders vote (1 NFT = 1 vote)"
  
  governance_example: |
    function voteOnTrait(string memory trait, int256 delta) external {
        require(cog.balanceOf(msg.sender) > 0);
        persona[trait] += delta * voteWeight[msg.sender];
    }

# Critical Optimizations

## Layer-2 for AI Operations
layer2_optimizations:
  zk_rollups: "Prove query correctness without full blockchain execution"
  energon_subnets: "Dedicated chains for AR/VR queries (low-latency) and Financial analysis (high-security)"

## Hybrid Retrieval Tricks
hybrid_retrieval:
  vector_cache_nfts: "Pay 5 Energon to pin a Weaviate vector on-chain for 1hr"
  mongodb_shard_bidding: "Highest Energon staker gets fastest MongoDB replica"

## Anti-Gaming Measures
anti_gaming:
  sybil_resistance: "Cogs must prove GPU work (hash of model weights) to mint"
  energon_sinks: "Burn 0.1% of tokens per query to prevent inflation"
