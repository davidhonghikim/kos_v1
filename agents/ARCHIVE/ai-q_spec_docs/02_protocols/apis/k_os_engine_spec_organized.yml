# ⚙️ kOS Engine Specification

The **kOS Engine** is the orchestration core of the entire kOS ecosystem. It acts as the central nervous system, responsible for lifecycle management of agents, flow control, state tracking, event dispatching, and system telemetry aggregation.

---

## ✅ Responsibilities of the kOS Engine

| Subsystem                     | Function                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Lifecycle Manager**   | Starts, monitors, restarts, suspends, and terminates agents            |
| **Flow Regulator**            | Manages system pacing, execution interval throttling, and load control |
| **Event Bus Manager**         | Routes events between agents and system layers                         |
| **Telemetry Collector**       | Tracks CPU usage, memory state, agent health, and error rates          |
| **Mood Signal Generator**     | Calculates mood states (for DOPE layer) based on telemetry inputs      |
| **Orchestration API**         | Exposes internal control functions to UI, CLI, or external systems     |
| **State Persistence Handler** | Writes critical runtime state to the Memory layer                      |
| **Failure Recovery Manager**  | Monitors and recovers failed or stalled agents                         |

---

## ✅ Core Internal Modules (Subcomponents)

| Module                     | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `heartbeat_scheduler.py`   | Governs global tick rate and pacing of execution cycles          |
| `agent_dispatcher.py`      | Starts, stops, monitors, and scales agents dynamically           |
| `event_bus.py`             | Provides publish/subscribe pattern for inter-agent communication |
| `telemetry_collector.py`   | Gathers and stores system health metrics                         |
| `mood_signal_generator.py` | Calculates system mood states for DOPE or agent mood adjustments |
| `state_manager.py`         | Maintains global runtime state across cycles                     |
| `flow_regulator.py`        | Enforces flow limits and rate control based on system load       |
| `orchestration_api.py`     | Provides programmatic access for external control interfaces     |

---

## ✅ Engine Execution Loop

**Pseudocode Summary:**

```python
while True:
    telemetry_data = telemetry_collector.sample()
    mood_signal = mood_signal_generator.update(telemetry_data)
    flow_regulator.adjust(telemetry_data)
    event_bus.broadcast_pending()
    agent_dispatcher.execute_cycle()
    state_manager.persist_state()
    time.sleep(flow_regulator.tick_interval)
```

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `tick_interval`               | Global execution cycle interval    | 0.5 seconds    |
| `max_parallel_agents`         | Cap on concurrent active agents    | 100            |
| `telemetry_sample_rate`       | Frequency of telemetry sampling    | Every tick     |
| `state_persistence_frequency` | How often state is written to disk | Every 10 ticks |
| `event_queue_size`            | Size limit for event queue         | 1000 events    |
| `failure_restart_threshold`   | Max restarts allowed per agent     | 3 attempts     |

## ✅ Telemetry Metrics Tracked

| Metric              | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| CPU Utilization     | Real-time system CPU usage                      |
| Memory Load         | Current RAM consumption                         |
| Active Agent Count  | Number of running agents                        |
| Failed Agent Count  | Total agents failed this cycle                  |
| Mood Score          | Calculated mood intensity for the current state |

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent Failure        | Attempt restart up to `failure_restart_threshold` times |
| High CPU Load        | Reduce tick frequency, throttle agent starts            |
| Memory Pressure      | Pause non-critical agents, activate flow control        |
| Event Queue Overflow | Drop non-critical events, log critical warning          |
| State Write Failure  | Retry up to 3 times, escalate if persisting issue       |

## ✅ Engine-Orchestrated Agent Lifecycle States

| State       | Meaning                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Initialized | Agent created but not started                     |
| Active      | Running agent, executing tasks                    |
| Suspended   | Temporarily halted by Engine for flow reasons     |
| Orphaned    | Lost control or failed to report health           |
| Retired     | Gracefully ended agent                            |
| Terminated  | Force-killed agent after failure or policy breach |

| `/broadcast_event` | Send an event to the Event Bus      |
| `/adjust_flow`     | Manually override flow parameters   |

---

## ✅ Testing and Validation Requirements

- Unit tests for each internal module
- Engine stress tests with simulated agent load
- Chaos-mode tests for fault recovery
- Performance benchmarks for high agent count scenarios

---

## ✅ Closing Statement

The **kOS Engine** is the deterministic, fail-soft, modular orchestration core that keeps the entire kOS ecosystem alive, adaptive, and flowing under all conditions.
