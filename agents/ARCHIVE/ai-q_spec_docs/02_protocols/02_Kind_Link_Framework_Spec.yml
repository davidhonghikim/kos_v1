  title: 'Kind Link Framework (KLF) Specification: The kOS Nervous System'
  description: Technical specification for the kOS inter-node communication Framework,
    the 'nervous system' of the digital organism.
  type: Framework
  status: proposal
  priority: critical
  last_updated: '2025-06-25'
  version: 2.1.0
  agent_notes: Refactored to frame KLF as the 'nervous system' and its authentication
    as an 'immune response,' completing the biological metaphor.

  title: 1. Overview
  type: section
  content: 'The Kind Link Framework (KLF) is the **nervous system** of the kOS ecosystem.
    It is the mandatory communication Framework that allows individual **cells (nodes)**
    to form **tissues, organs, and complex organisms (federations)**. It ensures secure,
    interoperable communication, enabling coordinated action and shared sensation
    across the entire digital lifeform.


    -   **Transport:** Secure HTTP (HTTPS) - The medium for nerve signals.

    -   **Message Format:** JSON-RPC 2.0 - The structure of a nerve impulse.

    -   **Authentication:** Cryptographic Signatures (Ed25519) - The cellular immune
    response.'
- level: 2
  title: '2. Authentication: The Immune Response (Self/Non-Self Recognition)'
  type: section
  content: Every KLF request must be authenticated. This functions as a cellular **immune
    response**, allowing a node to instantly recognize signals from "self" (other
    nodes sharing the same core DNA) versus "non-self" (foreign or potentially malicious
    actors).
- level: 3
  title: 2.1. Cellular Identity (Genetic Markers)
  type: section
  content: 'Each kOS cell (node) MUST have a unique Decentralized Identifier (DID)
    and an associated Ed25519 key pair, which acts as its unique genetic marker.

    -   **Example DID:** `did:kos:griot:a1b2c3d4e5f6...`'
- level: 3
  title: 2.2. Request Signing (Sending a Nerve Impulse)
  type: section
  content: 'All KLF requests must include two custom HTTP headers:

    -   `X-KOS-Node-ID`: The DID of the sending cell.

    -   `X-KOS-Signature`: A signature of the nerve impulse (request body).


    The signing process ensures that the nerve impulse is authentic and has not been
    tampered with in transit.'
- level: 3
  title: 2.3. Request Verification (Receiving a Nerve Impulse)
  type: section
  content: 'The receiving cell''s "immune system" MUST perform the following steps:

    1.  Identify the sending cell via `X-KOS-Node-ID`.

    2.  Retrieve the cell''s public key (its known genetic marker).

    3.  Verify the signature of the impulse.

    4.  If verification fails, the immune system rejects the impulse with a `401 Unauthorized`
    error, preventing a foreign signal from affecting the cell.'
- level: 2
  title: 3. Core KLF Methods (Nerve Signals)
  type: section
  content: All kOS cells MUST be able to send and receive these fundamental nerve
    signals.
- level: 3
  title: '`KLF_ping`'
  type: section
  content: 'A simple "are you alive?" signal.

    -   **Params:** `null`

    -   **Result:** `{ "status": "pong", "timestamp": "..." }`'
- level: 3
  title: '`KLF_getIdentity`'
  type: section
  content: 'Requests the full genetic identity of another cell.

    -   **Params:** `null`

    -   **Result:** The full Node Identity JSON object, including its `hierosCodex`
    hash. This is the core of the immune recognition system.'
- level: 3
  title: '`KLF_getCapabilities`'
  type: section
  content: 'Asks another cell, "What is your specialized function?"

    -   **Params:** `context` (Object, Optional): The reason for asking.

    -   **Result:** An object listing the cell''s functions (e.g., `replication`,
    `data_curation`).'
- level: 3
  title: '`KLF_proposeFederation`'
  type: section
  content: 'The signal to initiate the formation of a new "tissue" or "organ."

    -   **Params:** Details of the proposed federation.

    -   **Result:** A status indicating if the proposal is being considered.


    **Note on Tissue Formation:** The receiving cell will first call `KLF_getIdentity`
    on the proposing cell. If the `hierosCodex` hash does not match its own, the immune
    system may automatically reject the federation attempt, recognizing the other
    cell as genetically incompatible.'
