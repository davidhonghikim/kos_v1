  title: Agent Context
  type: section
  content: '**For AI Agents**: Complete UI component library documentation covering
    reusable components, design patterns, and component architecture. Use this when
    implementing UI components, understanding component design, planning UI architecture,
    or building user interface systems. Essential reference for all UI component development
    work.


    **Implementation Notes**: Contains UI component architecture, design patterns,
    component implementation guidelines, and reusable component documentation. Includes
    detailed component system design and user interface development patterns.

    **Quality Requirements**: Keep UI component documentation and design patterns
    synchronized with actual component implementation. Maintain accuracy of component
    architecture and user interface design principles.

    **Integration Points**: Foundation for UI development, links to design systems,
    user interface architecture, and component frameworks for comprehensive UI component
    coverage.


    This document outlines the most important React components that form the Kai-CD
    user interface.'

  title: Main Views & Layout
  type: section
  content: 'These components define the overall structure of the application.


    -   **`Tab.tsx`**: The primary application shell. It renders the main two-column
    layout, including the far-left navigation rail (for switching between Services,
    Settings, etc.) and the main content panel. It is the root component for the main
    `tab.html` page.

    -   **`Popup.tsx`**: The root component for the browser action popup. It displays
    a list of available services and provides buttons to open them in the Tab or Side
    Panel.

    -   **`Sidepanel.tsx`**: The root component for the Chrome Side Panel. It''s a
    simple container that renders the `CapabilityUI` for the currently active service.'
- level: 2
  title: Core Dynamic Components
  type: section
  content: 'These components are the heart of the "data-driven UI" philosophy.


    -   **`CapabilityUI.tsx`**: This is not a view itself, but a **router**. It takes
    a `service` object, inspects its `capabilities` array, and uses the `registry`
    to render the appropriate view component (e.g., `LlmChatView`). This allows the
    application to support any type of service without changing the core layout.

    -   **`capabilities/registry.tsx`**: A simple map that associates a capability
    string (e.g., `''llm_chat''`) with the React component that can render it. This
    is the central registry for all "capability views."

    -   **`ParameterControl.tsx`**: A generic component that renders the correct form
    input for a given parameter definition. It uses a `switch` statement on the parameter''s
    `type` (`''string''`, `''number''`, `''boolean''`, `''select''`) to render a text
    input, a slider, a toggle, or a dropdown menu, respectively. This component is
    used heavily within capability views.'

  title: Capability Views
  type: section
  content: "These are the specialized, high-level components that provide the UI for\
    \ a specific AI task. They are rendered by `CapabilityUI`.\n\n-   **`capabilities/LlmChatView.tsx`**:\
    \ The complete, feature-rich interface for conversational AI. It is composed of\
    \ smaller components:\n    -   **`ChatMessageList.tsx`**: Renders the list of\
    \ user and assistant messages.\n    -   **`ChatInputForm.tsx`**: Provides the\
    \ text area for user input, including logic for handling submission and a \"stop\
    \ generating\" button.\n    -   **`ModelSelector.tsx`**: A dropdown for selecting\
    \ the specific model to use for the chat, powered by the `useModelList` hook.\n\
    -   **`capabilities/ImageGenerationView.tsx`**: The interface for text-to-image\
    \ generation. It includes a prompt input, a gallery for generated images, and\
    \ a panel for adjusting parameters.\n    -   **NOTE:** As identified during the\
    \ code review, this component has a major architectural flaw: it uses local `useState`\
    \ for all its state, meaning parameters and generated images are lost when the\
    \ user navigates away. This is a high-priority item for refactoring."

  title: Service & Data Management
  type: section
  content: 'These components provide the administrative interface for the application.


    -   **`ServiceManagement.tsx`**: The main screen for managing services. It displays
    a list of all configured services and allows the user to add, edit, or delete
    them. It uses the `ServiceForm` component.

    -   **`ServiceForm.tsx`**: A detailed form used for both creating a new service
    and editing an existing one. It includes fields for name, credentials, and the
    base URL. It contains complex logic for dynamically generating helper URLs as
    the user types.

    -   **`DataManagement.tsx`**: The view that contains the `ImportExportButtons`
    and the `BugReportView`, providing a central place for data-related operations.

    -   **`ImportExportButtons.tsx`**: Provides buttons to trigger the `backupManager`
    utility to download a full backup of application data or to upload a backup file
    to restore from.'
- level: 2
  title: Common Components
  type: section
  content: '-   **`SettingsView.tsx`**: The form for changing global application settings,
    such as the theme and log level.

    -   **`ConsoleLogView.tsx`**: Renders the contents of the `logStore`, providing
    a live, in-app view of system logs.

    -   **`StatusIndicator.tsx`**: A small dot component that displays the health
    status of a service (green for healthy, red for unhealthy, gray for unknown).'
