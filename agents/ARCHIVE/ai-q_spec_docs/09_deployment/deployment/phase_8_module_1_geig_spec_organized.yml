# Phase 8 Module Specification – Module 1: GEIG (Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway)

## Module Name

**GEIG – Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway**

## Purpose

GEIG acts as the first and most critical filter for ethical alignment and interoperability across all agents, nodes, and external systems interacting with kOS. It ensures that all inter-agent communication, external inputs, API calls, and decision-making pathways align with the core ethical principles defined in the HIEROS Code.

GEIG also serves as a bias detection, mitigation, and audit layer for all agent interactions, both inbound and outbound.

## Functional Overview

### Primary Functions:

1. **Ethical Compliance Enforcement**

   - Real-time filtering of all incoming and outgoing agent communications
   - Alignment checks against the HIEROS ethical ruleset
   - Dynamic ethical context evaluation

2. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**

   - NLP-driven bias scanning for text, decision trees, and generated content
   - Statistical anomaly detection in decision outcomes across demographic groups
   - Automated flagging and corrective action pipelines

3. **Cross-Agent Ethical Mediation**

   - Ethical arbitration layer between agents with conflicting goals or decision paths
   - Consensus protocol for ethical resolution
   - Optional quorum or human-in-the-loop override mechanisms

4. **Audit Logging and Traceability**

   - Full, immutable logging of ethical decision points and filter actions
   - Cryptographic signing of filter decisions for non-repudiation

5. **External API Ethical Gateway**

   - Ethical checks on all third-party API calls or external inputs
   - Rate limiting and throttling if ethical risk thresholds are triggered

## Detailed Module Architecture

### Input Channels:

- Inter-agent communication streams
- External API calls
- System-level event triggers
- User inputs (direct or indirect)

### Output Channels:

- Filtered and approved messages
- Ethical violation alerts
- Bias audit logs
- Quarantine queue for flagged actions

### Core Components:

| Component                            | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ethical Rule Engine (ERE)**        | Dynamic policy engine that evaluates each data packet against the HIEROS rulebook |
| **Bias Detection Subsystem (BDS)**   | Runs NLP and statistical models to detect latent bias patterns                    |
| **Ethical Consensus Mediator (ECM)** | Manages multi-agent ethical conflict resolution sessions                          |
| **Ethical Audit Logger (EAL)**       | Immutable event logger with cryptographic timestamps                              |
| **Ethical Quarantine Manager (EQM)** | Holds and escalates suspect transactions until reviewed or auto-resolved          |
| **API Gateway Filter (AGF)**         | External API transaction filter enforcing rate, scope, and ethical policy checks  |

## Key Algorithms and Processes

1. **Ethical Scoring Algorithm (ESA)**

   - Inputs: Message payload, sender/receiver context, historical decision profile
   - Output: Ethical risk score (0.0 - 1.0)
   - Thresholds configurable based on deployment context

2. **Bias Deviation Analysis (BDA)**

   - Inputs: Message metadata, demographic mapping (if available), decision impact log
   - Output: Bias risk factor per protected class

3. **Ethical Conflict Resolution Protocol (ECRP)**

   - Steps:
     1. Conflict detection
     2. Ethical rule prioritization
     3. Consensus round among agent parties
     4. Optional human escalation

4. **Immutable Logging Process (ILP)**

   - SHA-256 hash chaining per log entry
   - Optional external notarization

5. **API Ethics Filter Routine (AEFR)**

   - Pre-check: API source trust level
   - Post-check: Content analysis and ethical scoring

## API Endpoints (Internal to kOS)

| Endpoint                 | Method | Description                            |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `/geig/validate`         | POST   | Submit message for ethical validation  |
| `/geig/bias_check`       | POST   | Run bias detection scan on payload     |
| `/geig/conflict_resolve` | POST   | Initiate inter-agent ethical mediation |
| `/geig/logs`             | GET    | Retrieve ethical decision logs         |
| `/geig/quarantine`       | GET    | List all currently quarantined actions |

---

## Dependencies

- **HIEROS Ethical Ruleset Database (HERD)**
- **kOS Core Messaging Bus**
- **kOS Identity Manager (for sender/receiver verification)**
- **kOS Cryptographic Module**

---

## Deployment Considerations

- Should run as a dedicated high-priority microservice
- Must be horizontally scalable for high-volume environments
- Supports hot-reload of ethical policy updates without downtime
- Requires low-latency performance for real-time communication filtering

---

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- Unit tests for each component (ERE, BDS, ECM, EAL, EQM, AGF)
- Simulated bias injection tests
- Ethical edge-case scenarios (e.g., trolley problem variants for agents)
- Load and performance benchmarks
- Immutable logging validation

---

## Future Extensions

- Machine learning-based ethical adaptation (reinforcement learning loop)
- Federated ethical consensus across multiple kOS deployments
- End-user customizable ethical overlays (user-defined ethical priorities)
