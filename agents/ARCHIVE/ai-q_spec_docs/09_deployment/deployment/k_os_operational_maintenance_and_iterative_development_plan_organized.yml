## 1. Operational Support Framework

### 1.1 Support Team Structure
- Tier 1: Frontline system monitoring and basic troubleshooting
- Tier 2: Agent management, node orchestration, and performance tuning
- Tier 3: Development, ethical auditing, and deep system diagnostics

### 1.2 Support Hours and Availability
- 24/7 monitoring for critical infrastructure
- Standard business hours for low-priority issues
- On-call escalation for ethical violations or security breaches

---

## 2. Maintenance Procedures

### 2.1 Routine Maintenance Windows
- Weekly non-disruptive maintenance (minor patches)
- Monthly major maintenance window (GEIG updates, node upgrades)
- Quarterly deep maintenance (full system audits, database optimization)

### 2.2 Patch Management
- Automated CI/CD deployment of minor patches
- Staged rollout with canary node validation for major updates
- GEIG ethical validation required for any behavioral code changes

### 2.3 Backup and Recovery
- Daily incremental backups
- Weekly full system snapshots
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills

---

## 3. Monitoring and Incident Response
