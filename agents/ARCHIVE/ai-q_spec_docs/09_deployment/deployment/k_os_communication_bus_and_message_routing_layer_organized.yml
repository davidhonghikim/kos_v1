# kOS Communication Bus and Message Routing Layer

## Overview
The **kOS Communication Bus and Message Routing Layer (CBMRL)** forms the communication backbone for all intra-node and inter-node data flows. It ensures reliable, scalable, and secure message delivery between agents, nodes, system services, and external interfaces.

CBMRL handles task requests, telemetry data, system alerts, user interactions, and inter-agent coordination, providing multiple protocol supports, routing algorithms, and prioritization schemes.

---

## 1. Core Components

### 1.1 Message Bus Engine
- Central message broker service for each node.
- Supports publish-subscribe (PubSub), direct messaging, and broadcast models.

### 1.2 Routing Engine
- Determines optimal delivery paths.
- Supports point-to-point, multicast, and broadcast routing modes.
- Latency and load-aware dynamic routing adjustments.

### 1.3 Message Serialization/Deserialization Module
- Supports JSON, Protobuf, and optional Flatbuffers.
- Payload compression for large messages.

### 1.4 Security and Integrity Layer
- End-to-end encryption (TLS or custom secure channels).
- GEIG compliance checks for ethical transmission.
- Message authentication with agent-signed payloads.

---

## 2. Supported Protocols

- **gRPC**
- **WebSocket**
- **HTTP/REST**
- **MQTT**
- **ZeroMQ (Optional for lightweight nodes)**
- **LoRa / BLE / RF Interfaces (For off-grid communication)**

---

## 3. Message Types Handled

- Task dispatch instructions
- Agent-to-agent commands
- System health updates
- Telemetry and metrics streams
- Event and trigger broadcasts
- External API request/response payloads

---

## 4. Routing Algorithms

- Static route tables for small clusters
- Dynamic latency-aware routing for large-scale deployments
- Failure-aware path rerouting
- Prioritized routing for critical system messages

---

## 5. Message Queueing Features

- Persistent message queues with delivery retry mechanisms
- Dead-letter queue support for undeliverable messages
- Configurable message TTL (Time To Live)
- Backpressure control to prevent overloads

---

## 6. API Endpoints

- `/cbmrl/message/send`
- `/cbmrl/message/subscribe`
- `/cbmrl/message/history`
- `/cbmrl/routing/metrics`
- `/cbmrl/bus/health`
- `/cbmrl/config`

---

## 7. Telemetry and Monitoring

- Real-time message throughput metrics
- Latency monitoring per message type
- Failure rate dashboards
- Optional Prometheus and Grafana integration

---

## 8. Reliability and Redundancy

- Multi-broker cluster support
- Automatic failover between message brokers
- Transactional message delivery guarantees (exactly-once delivery optional)

---

## 9. Ethical and Security Filters

- GEIG hooks on all external message ingress and egress points
- Rate limiting for spam or malicious message patterns
- Payload scanning for ethical compliance and data integrity

---

## 10. Future Expansion Areas

- AI-assisted dynamic routing optimization
- Cross-cloud message federation support
- Built-in anomaly detection for message patterns
- Integrated message caching layer for high-demand channels

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Communication Bus and Message Routing Layer (CBMRL)** provides the critical infrastructure for secure, scalable, and efficient communication across the entire kOS ecosystem, ensuring every agent, node, and service remains connected, responsive, and ethically aligned.
