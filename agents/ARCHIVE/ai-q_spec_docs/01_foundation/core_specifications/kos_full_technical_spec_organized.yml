kOS:
  overview:
    description: kOS (Kind Operating System) is a decentralized, agent-based, ethical,
      and regenerative digital operating system designed to run across personal devices,
      servers, and edge nodes. It empowers individuals and organizations to deploy
      modular AI agents that collaborate autonomously across networks, including LoRa,
      WiFi, and mesh-based systems like Reticulum.
    influences:
    - The KLF / JAMs (The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu)
    - Systema / Taoist Systems Theory
    - Underground Resistance (UR)
    - Biological Systems and Neurogenesis
    - Distributed Ledger Technologies
    - UNIX Philosophy and Microkernel Design
    core_philosophy: Decentralization, sovereignty, regeneration, fun, ethical intelligence,
      natural system modeling
  architecture:
    layers:

      description: Autonomous agents (13 primary classes) that perform tasks, reason,
        collaborate, and learn.
    - name: Orchestrator Layer
      description: Controls agent lifecycles, schedules, coordination, and data flow
        between agents and users.
    - name: Data Layer
      description: Supports vector stores, knowledge bases, temporal memory, and encrypted
        user vaults.
    - name: Network Layer
