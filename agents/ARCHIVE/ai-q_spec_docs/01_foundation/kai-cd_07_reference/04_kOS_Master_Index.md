# kOS Master Documentation Index

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: Comprehensive index for navigating kOS-related documentation across current and future directories. Use to locate specific kOS components, architecture, services, and implementation details.

**Implementation Notes**: Provides structured navigation for kOS/kAI system documentation with numbered index format. Maps foundation documents, architecture, protocols, and services with file locations.
**Quality Requirements**: Keep index synchronized with actual file locations and content. Update links when files are moved or renamed in future/ and related directories.
**Integration Points**: Primary navigation tool for kOS ecosystem documentation. Links to 06_future/ content and provides complete system overview for development teams.

> **Agent Context**: This document serves as the master navigation index for all kOS and kAI documentation. Use this when locating specific architectural components, protocols, or implementation details. All documents follow consistent naming conventions and include comprehensive implementation details as required for multi-agent development.

## Quick Summary
Master index providing navigation structure for all KindOS (kOS) and KindAI (kAI) documentation, including architectural blueprints, component specifications, protocols, configuration schemas, and operational workflows.

## System Summary

### KindAI (kAI)
A personal AI framework, application gateway, and orchestration client. Deployment modes:
- Browser extension
- Desktop app
- Embedded interface
- Secure agent controller

### KindOS (kOS)
A decentralized operating stack built for AI-human collaboration:
- Secure, interoperable multi-agent mesh
- Governance, routing, protocols
- Data and service control
- Local-first but cloud/peer-optional

## Documentation Structure Overview

All documents follow standardized structure:
- **Prefix ID**: Numerical order for deterministic navigation
- **Title**: Descriptive with consistent casing
- **Purpose**: Build-ready implementation detail
- **Agent Context**: Specific guidance for AI agents
- **Frontmatter**: Complete YAML metadata

- External interfaces use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `/api/load-service-config`)

## Documentation Conventions

### Naming Standards
- **Files**: `##_Title_Case_With_Underscores.md`
- **Directories**: lowercase with hyphens
- **Classes**: CamelCase
- **APIs**: lowercase-with-hyphens

### Content Requirements
