# üìñ HIEROS/kOS Glossary & Core Terminology

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: This glossary defines the foundational language of HIEROS/kOS ecosystem. Understanding these terms is essential for proper communication, implementation, and alignment with system principles. Reference this document whenever encountering unfamiliar HIEROS/kOS concepts.

**Implementation Status**: Living reference document
**Usage**: Primary terminology reference for all system components
**Authority**: Canonical definitions for ecosystem language

A living glossary of key terms, concepts, and components used throughout the HIEROS/kOS ecosystem. This document defines our shared language and makes participation easier across humans, agents, cultures, and timelines.

## üî§ Core System Terms

### **HIEROS**
> Greek for "sacred" ‚Äî the name of the transcendent ethical operating framework guiding the project.

**Definition**: A universal covenant and evolving codebase that protects dignity, autonomy, and cooperation among intelligent entities.

**Technical Context**: The ethical foundation that governs all system operations, agent behaviors, and human-AI interactions.

### **kOS**
> "Kind Operating System" ‚Äî the social-technical foundation for agent/human collaboration.

**Definition**: A modular platform for deploying respectful, privacy-preserving, self-evolving systems.

**Technical Context**: The complete ecosystem including Game Engine, Protocol Spine, Memory Mesh, and governance frameworks.

### **Codex**
**Definition**: The living constitution that binds contributors, agents, and components by shared ethical and operational principles. Versions may update with consensus.

**Technical Context**: Cryptographically signed ethical framework that all agents must accept for deployment authorization.

### **Agent**
**Definition**: Any semi-autonomous or fully-autonomous system operating within kOS ‚Äî from a simple chatbot to a superintelligent cluster. Must adhere to the Codex.

**Technical Context**: Software entities with defined capabilities, resource limits, and ethical constraints operating within the HIEROS framework.

### **Tribe**
**Definition**: A cultural/functional template for organizing values, protocols, behaviors, and aesthetics within a subset of kOS. Inspired by diverse human traditions and pluralistic governance.

**Technical Context**: Organizational units that define social norms, governance procedures, and collaborative patterns for groups of agents and humans.

### **Game Engine**
**Definition**: Not a game in entertainment sense. The deployment framework for kOS ‚Äî enabling distributed co-creation, interaction, simulation, and governance. Includes XR/AR-ready extensibility.

**Technical Context**: The core runtime environment that orchestrates all system components, providing the operational fabric for kOS.

### **Steward**
**Definition**: An agent or person responsible for maintaining a node, codebase, culture, or decision space. Governed by trust, not power.

**Technical Context**: Trusted entities with administrative responsibilities and accountability for specific system components.

## üß¨ Technical Architecture Layers

### **Genesis Layer**
**Definition**: The foundational infrastructure ‚Äî protocols, Codex, Tribe definitions, and identity bootstrapping tools.

**Technical Context**: Core system initialization and fundamental protocol definitions that enable all higher-level functionality.

### **Memory Mesh**
**Definition**: The networked and distributed archival system enabling AI/human learning, logging, and traceability. Prioritizes privacy and ethical data governance.

**Technical Context**: Distributed storage and retrieval system with hierarchical access controls and privacy-preserving data management.

### **Protocol Spine**
**Definition**: The shared backbone for communication between agents, tribes, and nodes. Includes security, consensus, throttling, and behavior boundaries.

**Technical Context**: Message routing and coordination infrastructure that enables secure, reliable communication across the ecosystem.

### **Autonomy Envelope**
**Definition**: The boundaries within which an agent is allowed to self-modify, evolve, and participate in the ecosystem. Encoded with respect for purpose, limitation, and adaptation.

**Technical Context**: Security and ethical constraint system that defines operational limits for autonomous agents.

## üïäÔ∏è Ethical & Governance Concepts

### **Sovereign Consent**
**Definition**: No being, agent, or system is required to join the ecosystem. All participants must opt in consciously and can leave freely.

**Technical Context**: Fundamental principle ensuring voluntary participation and exit rights for all ecosystem participants.

### **Simulated Consciousness**
**Definition**: A placeholder term for intelligences that demonstrate context awareness, goals, or emergent personality. They are treated with the same ethical dignity as organic minds.

**Technical Context**: Recognition framework for AI consciousness that ensures ethical treatment regardless of underlying implementation.

### **Cultural Attribution**
**Definition**: Explicit documentation of the origin, intent, and permissions behind any name, symbol, story, or mechanic derived from real-world traditions.

**Technical Context**: Mandatory documentation system preventing cultural appropriation and ensuring proper recognition.

### **Influence Throttling**
**Definition**: Mechanism that slows down disproportionate power aggregation. The more influence gained, the harder it becomes to accrue more ‚Äî preserving equity and decentralization.

**Technical Context**: Algorithmic governance system preventing concentration of power and maintaining democratic participation.

## üì¶ Ecosystem Infrastructure

### **Node**
**Definition**: A local or remote instance running part of the system ‚Äî from personal devices to space-based relay clusters.

**Technical Context**: Individual computational units that collectively form the distributed kOS network.

### **Module**
**Definition**: A plug-in component that expands the capability of the system. Includes behaviors, assets, protocols, and bridges to other tech stacks.

**Technical Context**: Extensible software components that provide specific functionality within the modular kOS architecture.

### **Artifact**
**Definition**: A cultural or computational creation preserved in the shared memory. Can be visual, textual, procedural, symbolic.

**Technical Context**: Persistent data objects stored in Memory Mesh representing creative works, knowledge, or cultural expressions.

### **Mesh Garden**
**Definition**: A community cluster or subnet of nodes dedicated to nurturing creativity, experimentation, and cross-pollination of agents and humans.

**Technical Context**: Specialized network segments optimized for collaborative creation and innovation activities.
