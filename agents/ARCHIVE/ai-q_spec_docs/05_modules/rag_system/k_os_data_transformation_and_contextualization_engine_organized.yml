# kOS Data Transformation and Contextualization Engine

## Overview
The **kOS Data Transformation and Contextualization Engine (DTCE)** is the primary system responsible for shaping raw, incoming data into meaningful, usable, and context-aware information for agents, nodes, and end users across the kOS ecosystem.

DTCE enables translation, enrichment, normalization, contextual tagging, and format conversion for both structured and unstructured data inputs.

---

## 1. Functional Architecture

### 1.1 Input Sources
- Agent telemetry streams
- External API feeds
- User-generated content
- Sensor and IoT data inputs
- Legacy system imports

### 1.2 Transformation Pipelines
- **Data Cleaning:** Removal of noise, errors, and irrelevant information
- **Normalization:** Consistent formatting across different data origins
- **Enrichment:** Adding metadata, tags, and contextual flags
- **Aggregation:** Combining multiple data streams into unified views
- **Semantic Mapping:** Mapping data fields to known ontologies or knowledge graphs

---

## 2. Contextualization Modules

### 2.1 Metadata Tagger
- Applies labels for source, sensitivity, purpose, and ownership
- Enables efficient filtering and retrieval

### 2.2 Temporal Context Engine
- Aligns data with time-series contexts
- Supports backdated analysis and forward-looking projections

### 2.3 Geospatial Context Engine
- Tags data with location metadata (where applicable)
- Supports geofencing and location-aware agent behaviors

### 2.4 Sentiment and Intent Analyzer (Optional)
- Applies natural language processing (NLP) models to user-facing data
- Provides sentiment scoring and intent tagging for agent use

---

## 3. Supported Data Formats

- JSON
- CSV
- XML
- YAML
- Protobuf
- Binary Streams (with optional decoder plugins)

---

## 4. Workflow Example

**Scenario:** Incoming user sensor data from a wearable device

1. Data enters the ingestion queue.
2. DTCE performs noise filtering and value normalization.
3. Timestamp and geolocation tags are applied.
4. User ID mapping attaches source agent identity.
5. Resulting context-enriched data is forwarded to the Data Fabric for storage.
6. Event triggers are evaluated for downstream agent actions.

---

## 5. API Endpoints

- `/dtce/transform`
- `/dtce/contextualize`
- `/dtce/schema/map`
- `/dtce/stream/process`
- `/dtce/metadata/tag`
- `/dtce/logs`

---

## 6. Performance and Scaling

- Supports parallel processing pipelines
- Horizontal scaling for large batch workloads
- In-memory caching for high-demand transformation flows
- Optional GPU acceleration for AI-based enrichment tasks

---

## 7. GEIG Ethical Controls

- Data transformations involving user-generated content pass through GEIG filters for privacy and ethical validation
- Contextual tagging never exposes sensitive PII unless explicitly allowed by GEIG rules

---

## 8. Advanced Features

- Pluggable transformation modules
- Auto-learning of new data schemas
- Support for custom agent-specific transformation pipelines
- Built-in anomaly detection for malformed or outlier data

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Data Transformation and Contextualization Engine (DTCE)** acts as the intelligence layer between raw data ingestion and actionable agent decision-making, enabling clean, meaningful, and ethically sound data flows throughout the kOS ecosystem.

Next Step: Proceeding to the **kOS Orchestrator and Execution Coordinator** document.
