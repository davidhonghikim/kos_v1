# kOS Node Discovery and Topology Mapping Engine

## Overview
The **kOS Node Discovery and Topology Mapping Engine (NDTME)** is responsible for real-time detection, classification, and mapping of all active nodes within the kOS ecosystem. It creates a live, continuously updated spatial and logical map of the network, showing node relationships, geographic distribution, role assignments, and communication pathways.

NDTME enables the kOS ecosystem to maintain situational awareness, optimize task routing, enhance resilience, and dynamically adjust to network topology changes.

## 1. Functional Layers

### 1.1 Node Discovery Module
- **Passive Listening:** Detects incoming node broadcasts.
- **Active Probing:** Sends discovery pings within predefined network ranges.
- **Cross-Network Bridging:** Supports multi-subnet and VPN-based discovery.
- **Federated Node Registration:** Allows remote node joining via secure API calls.

### 1.2 Topology Mapping Module
- **Graph Database Backend:** Maintains a real-time network graph of node-to-node relationships.
- **Geospatial Tagging:** Nodes can optionally report GPS or location data.
- **Role Mapping:** Displays Node Class and active agent population per node.
- **Latency and Bandwidth Metrics:** Continuously measures and updates communication performance between nodes.

### 1.3 Health and Status Monitor
- Live heartbeat tracking for each node.
- Fault detection and isolation triggers.
- Real-time status updates (Online, Offline, Degraded, Maintenance).

---

## 2. Node Onboarding Workflow

1. **Node Boot Sequence:** New node starts with minimal configuration.
2. **Discovery Request Broadcast:** Node announces presence over discovery channels.
3. **Authentication and GEIG Check:** Node undergoes security and ethical compliance checks.
4. **Topology Graph Update:** NDTME logs node details and connection paths.
5. **Role Assignment Notification:** Node receives acknowledgment and assigned role information.

---

## 3. Communication Protocols Supported

- UDP Broadcast (for local subnet discovery)
- mDNS / SSDP (optional)
- WebSocket Mesh Overlay
- RESTful Node Registration APIs
- Optional LoRa, Bluetooth, or RF interfaces for off-grid node clusters

---

## 4. Topology Visualization Features

- Real-time interactive network map (kOS Dashboard integration)
- Node filters by class, health status, geographic region, or load level
- Dynamic zoom for micro and macro-level network views
- Historical topology playback for outage analysis

---

## 5. Fault Detection and Recovery

- Heartbeat failure triggers isolation flags
- Automated rerouting of critical workloads away from unstable nodes
- Cluster-wide alerting for node failures
- Optional autonomous repair scripting

---

## 6. API Endpoints

- `/ndtme/nodes/active`
- `/ndtme/nodes/topology`
- `/ndtme/node/register`
- `/ndtme/node/status/{node_id}`
- `/ndtme/node/heartbeat`
- `/ndtme/topology/graph`

---

## 7. Scalability Features

- Supports thousands of nodes per cluster
- Load-balanced topology graph storage
- Federated data rollups for cross-cluster environments
- Edge-node lightweight discovery modes for resource-constrained devices

---

## 8. Security Considerations

- All discovery broadcasts require cryptographic signing
- Node authentication via GEIG-tokenized handshake
- Replay attack protection
- Optional IP/Geo-fencing for critical infrastructure nodes

---

## 9. Optional Advanced Features

- AI-powered anomaly detection on network changes
- Latency-aware routing suggestions for task placement
- Federated cross-cloud topology management
- Integration with external network monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Node Discovery and Topology Mapping Engine (NDTME)** provides live network intelligence and situational awareness, forming the operational backbone for scalable, resilient, and secure multi-node deployments across the entire kOS ecosystem.
