# ✅ kOS Scalable Process Framework Resource Allocation Guide

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Solo Developer Deployment

| Resource Type | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Human | 1 developer (full-time for 1–2 weeks) |
| Compute | Single development laptop or desktop (8GB+ RAM, 100GB+ disk) |
| Software | Docker, Docker Compose, Python 3.11+, Node.js, MongoDB, Neo4j, Weaviate |
| Storage | ~20GB (Dev-level datasets + logs) |
| Networking | Localhost only |

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Team Scale – CI/CD + Testing

| Resource Type | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Human | 2–3 developers + 1 DevOps/Infra engineer |
| Compute | Single CI runner (GitHub Actions or self-hosted VM, 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM) |
| Software | GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, pytest, Docker registry, Prometheus setup |
| Storage | ~50GB (build artifacts, logs, container images) |
| Networking | Internal team network or shared cloud environment |

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Enterprise Multi-Node + Observability

| Resource Type | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Human | 4–6 developers + 2 DevOps + 1 SRE/Infra Architect + 1 Data Engineer |
| Compute | Kubernetes cluster (3+ nodes, 8–16 vCPUs per node, 32GB+ RAM per node) |
| Storage | ~500GB (logs, monitoring data, artifact registry, MongoDB/Neo4j/Weaviate data) |
| Software | Kubernetes, Helm, Istio/Linkerd, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, NGINX/Traefik |
| Networking | VPC, load balancer setup, external and internal endpoints |

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Federation and Global Mesh

| Resource Type | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Human | 6–10 developers + 2–3 SREs + 1 Security Engineer + 1 Governance Lead |
| Compute | Multi-cluster K8s environments across regions or data centers |
| Storage | 2TB+ (Federated Weaviate instances, global Neo4j graph replicas, S3-like object storage) |
| Software | Federated Weaviate config, cross-cluster Neo4j, encrypted messaging layers, global Prometheus federation |
| Networking | Peered VPCs, VPNs, TLS-based encrypted tunnels, zero-trust firewalls |

---

## ✅ Optional: Minimal Solo-to-Enterprise Bootstrap Path

| Milestone | Min Resources |
|---|---|
| Solo Dev | 1 laptop, Docker, local services |
| Small Team | 1 cloud VM + shared CI/CD runner |
| Small Enterprise | 3-node Kubernetes cluster (on-prem or cloud) |
| Federation | Multi-cloud or hybrid, with cross-region federation support |
