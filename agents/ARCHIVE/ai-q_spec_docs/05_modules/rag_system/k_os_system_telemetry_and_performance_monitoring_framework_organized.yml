# kOS System Telemetry and Performance Monitoring Framework

## Overview
The **kOS System Telemetry and Performance Monitoring Framework (STPMF)** provides real-time and historical monitoring of all system components, agents, node health, network performance, and workflow execution metrics across the kOS ecosystem.

STPMF enables proactive anomaly detection, capacity planning, ethical risk monitoring, and system optimization through high-resolution telemetry streams and advanced performance analytics.

---

## 1. Core Monitoring Domains

- Node health and uptime
- Agent lifecycle states and resource usage
- Task execution latency and success/failure rates
- Inter-node communication performance
- System load and throughput
- GEIG decision latency and ethical risk profiles
- Storage utilization and I/O metrics

---

## 2. Telemetry Data Pipeline

### 2.1 Data Collection Layer
- Lightweight agent-side telemetry collectors
- Node-level resource monitors
- Network traffic analyzers
- GEIG decision trace exporters

### 2.2 Ingestion and Aggregation Layer
- Streaming data pipeline (Apache Kafka, NATS, or custom kOS bus integration)
- Batch and real-time ingestion modes
- Support for high-frequency sampling rates

### 2.3 Storage Layer
- Time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
- Long-term archive tier (Object storage for historical roll-ups)

---

## 3. Metrics Categories

- **Infrastructure Metrics:** CPU, memory, disk, network I/O per node
- **Agent Metrics:** State transitions, execution time, error rates
- **Workflow Metrics:** Queue lengths, task completion rates, failure distributions
- **Communication Metrics:** Message throughput, latency, packet loss
- **Ethical Metrics:** GEIG decision volume, escalation rate, ethical risk trends

---

## 4. Alerting and Thresholds

- Configurable metric-based alert triggers
- Anomaly detection for metric drift or outlier events
- Rate-limit breach alerts
- Node offline detection
- Optional human-in-the-loop ethical escalation alerts

---

## 5. Visualization and Reporting

- Real-time dashboards (Grafana, Kibana, or kOS-native UI modules)
- Time-series graphing
- Heatmaps for agent workload distribution
- Ethical risk trend charts
- Custom report generation for audits

---

## 6. API Endpoints

- `/stpmf/metrics/current`
- `/stpmf/alerts/active`
- `/stpmf/history/query`
- `/stpmf/node/{node_id}/status`
- `/stpmf/agent/{agent_id}/metrics`
- `/stpmf/telemetry/export`

---

## 7. Ethical and Privacy Considerations

- GEIG validation on telemetry data collection policies
- Opt-out configurations for non-critical user telemetry
- Data anonymization for sensitive metric categories
- Encrypted telemetry streams

---

## 8. Advanced Features

- AI-driven anomaly detection and root cause analysis
- Predictive capacity forecasting
- Multi-cluster federation-wide telemetry roll-ups
- Temporal correlation between system events and ethical decisions

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS System Telemetry and Performance Monitoring Framework (STPMF)** provides a comprehensive, ethical, and scalable monitoring infrastructureâ€”empowering operators, agents, and governance nodes with actionable insights into the health, performance, and ethical status of the entire kOS ecosystem.
