# Phase 8 Module Specification – Module 3: NIMBUS (Node Initialization and Management Bus)

## Module Name

**NIMBUS – Node Initialization and Management Bus**

## Purpose

NIMBUS handles the full lifecycle of node-level management within the kOS ecosystem. It manages the initialization, configuration, registration, health checking, and shutdown of all participating nodes in a distributed deployment. NIMBUS ensures all nodes are network-aware, policy-compliant, and properly integrated with central orchestration layers before contributing compute, storage, or communication capacity.

## Functional Overview

### Primary Functions:

1. **Node Bootstrap Management**

   - Automated configuration and environment setup during node startup
   - Self-registration with kOS Orchestrator and Directory Services

2. **Node Health Monitoring**

   - Real-time collection of node-level telemetry: CPU, memory, disk, network, I/O health
   - Heartbeat signaling and failure detection

3. **Configuration Management**

   - Dynamic config fetching and hot reloading
   - Support for environment-variable, config file, and API-based config sources

4. **Node Service Registration**

   - Service discovery publication for active node capabilities
   - Dynamic updates as node roles change

5. **Graceful Shutdown and Drain Management**

   - Node draining: finish in-flight tasks before shutdown
   - Quorum notification on planned node exits

---

## Detailed Module Architecture

### Input Channels:

- Bootstrap scripts or deployment triggers
- Health telemetry from node subsystems
- Configuration updates from central kOS Config Manager
- Shutdown or drain signals

### Output Channels:

- Node state status to Orchestrator and OMNI
- Service discovery entries
- Health and resource telemetry feeds
- Shutdown notifications

### Core Components:

| Component                     | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bootstrap Engine (BE)**     | Automates the setup and initialization sequence for new nodes            |
| **Node Health Monitor (NHM)** | Collects and reports real-time system health metrics                     |
| **Config Fetcher (CF)**       | Pulls configuration profiles from central kOS config management services |
| **Service Registrar (SR)**    | Publishes node capabilities and active services to the Service Directory |
| **Shutdown Controller (SC)**  | Manages graceful shutdowns, node draining, and quorum notifications      |

## Key Algorithms and Processes

1. **Node Bootstrap Sequence (NBS)**

   - Steps:
     1. Environment validation
     2. Config profile loading
     3. Dependency checks
     4. Node registration

2. **Heartbeat and Failure Detection (HFD)**

   - Periodic liveness pings
   - Failure detection thresholds
   - Automatic node quarantine on missed heartbeats

3. **Dynamic Config Hot Reload (DCHR)**

   - Pull-based or push-based config updates
   - Zero-downtime config reload

4. **Service Discovery Publication (SDP)**

   - Auto-update on service capability changes
   - TTL (time-to-live) on service records

5. **Graceful Node Draining (GND)**

   - Signal interception
   - In-flight task completion
   - Final resource release

## API Endpoints (Internal to kOS)

| Endpoint                   | Method | Description                       |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| `/nimbus/bootstrap`        | POST   | Initiate node bootstrap process   |
| `/nimbus/health`           | GET    | Return current node health status |
| `/nimbus/config`           | GET    | Fetch node config profile         |
| `/nimbus/register_service` | POST   | Register service with Directory   |
| `/nimbus/drain`            | POST   | Begin node drain sequence         |
| `/nimbus/shutdown`         | POST   | Trigger graceful shutdown         |

---

## Dependencies

- **kOS Config Manager**
- **OMNI (Operational Metrics Layer)**
- **kOS Orchestrator**
- **Service Directory / Discovery Layer**
- **ARC (for pre-boot resource checks)**

---

## Deployment Considerations

- Lightweight and deployable on edge, cloud, or local hardware
- Must support containerized and bare-metal environments
- Highly resilient to partial network failures
- Should support delayed registration if network unavailable at first boot

---

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- Bootstrap process simulations across diverse environments
- Health signal drop-out scenarios
- Dynamic config reload stress tests
- Multi-node scaling tests (hundreds to thousands of nodes)
- Shutdown and drain test scenarios with in-flight workloads

---

## Future Extensions

- AI-driven auto-tuning of node startup parameters
- Remote out-of-band management capabilities (OOBM)
- Predictive node failure forecasting using OMNI telemetry analytics
