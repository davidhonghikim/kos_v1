# kOS Hybrid Recipe AI Framework Specification

## Overview

The kOS (Knowledge Operating System) Hybrid Recipe AI Framework is designed to enable rapid deployment, orchestration, and evolution of AI capabilities by composing external services, self-hosted tools, and custom in-house models into a single intelligent, conversational system. The system starts as a hybrid (commercial API + open source + local tools) and gradually evolves into a fully self-hosted, decentralized, and privacy-respecting AI infrastructure.

---

## Core Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| Leverage External Services First | Integrate commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Hugging Face) and open-source tools (LangChain, Ollama, LlamaIndex, etc.) for immediate capabilities. |
| Orchestrate via Recipes | Define all AI workflows using structured, modular, human-readable "recipes" in YAML/JSON/NLP style. |
| Adapters Layer | Develop pluggable adapters that connect kOS to each external service, tool, or model. |
| Skill Registry | Maintain a central registry of skills, tools, and available recipes. |
| AI Service Optimization | Let kOS dynamically choose the best-performing service or tool per task, based on latency, cost, and performance history. |
| Gradual Internalization | Over time, replace external services with in-house tools and models for cost, control, and privacy. |
| Natural Language UI | Maintain conversational, plain-language user interfaces throughout. |

---

## System Layers

| Layer | Function |
|---|---|
| External Services | Commercial AI APIs, cloud tools, SaaS endpoints. |
| Self-Hosted Tools | Local LLMs (Ollama, LocalAI), RAG stacks (LlamaIndex), vector databases (ChromaDB). |
| Adapter Layer | Translation modules to unify external API calls into internal kOS functions. |
| Skill Layer | Individual task-specific functions (summarization, translation, parsing, etc). |
| Recipe Layer | Declarative, human-readable instructions for chaining skills, tools, and models. |
| Orchestration Engine | The kOS logic that parses user input, selects recipes, executes steps, and manages tool calling. |
| Meta-Learning Layer | Tracks user preferences, workflow history, and performance data for self-optimization. |
| Natural Language Interface | Front-end where users talk to kOS like an assistant. |

---

## Phased Build Roadmap

| Phase | Focus |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | External Service Orchestration |
| Phase 2 | Adapter and Recipe Layer Maturity |
| Phase 3 | Hybrid Model Execution |
| Phase 4 | Privacy & Data Control Layer |
| Phase 5 | Full kOS Internal Replacement |
| Phase 6 | Federated & Distributed Execution |

---

## Technical Stack Per Layer

| Layer | Tools |
|---|---|
| External APIs | OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Google Cloud, AWS AI |
| Self-hosted LLMs | Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI, Llama.cpp |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB, Weaviate, Milvus |
| Orchestration | LangChain Agents, CrewAI, custom Python scripts |
| UI | Open WebUI, Chatbot-UI, AnythingLLM, custom FastAPI frontends |
| Data Vault | SQLite, DuckDB, local encrypted stores |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana, lightweight dashboards |

## Example Recipe (Human-Readable)

**Task:** Summarize a PDF and send result via Slack

**Steps:**
1. Receive PDF from user.
2. Use PDF Text Extractor Adapter.
3. Summarize text via LLM (OpenAI or Local).
4. Format summary.
5. Call Slack API Adapter with formatted text.
6. Confirm delivery to user.

---

## Adapter Layer Design

- Each external service gets a dedicated adapter module.
- Adapters handle:
  - API keys and auth
  - Input/output formatting
  - Error handling and retries
  - Standardized interfaces to the orchestration layer

Example adapters:
- OpenAIAdapter
- HuggingFaceAdapter
- OllamaAdapter
- SlackAdapter
- PDFAdapter

---

## Benefits of This Approach

| Benefit | Impact |
|---|---|
| Rapid Deployment | Start building AI capabilities immediately |
| Scalable | Add new services and tools easily |
| Future-Proof | Replace dependencies over time |
| Conversational UX | Users interact naturally |
| Privacy Control | Shift to self-hosted tools as needed |
| Knowledge Growth | AI learns best tool choices over time |

---

## Next Actions for Agent Teams

- Build Recipe Registry Schema
- Implement Adapter Interface Templates
- Draft Initial Recipe Library
- Set up External API keys and test connectivity
- Deploy local LLM runtime (Ollama/LocalAI)
- Establish logging and performance tracking for service selection optimization
