# kOS Hybrid AI Recipe Orchestration Master Specification

## Overview

The Knowledge Operating System (kOS) is a decentralized, agentic, modular AI orchestration framework that uses a hybrid approach to leverage commercial APIs, self-hosted open-source tools, and internal models via a **Recipe-Driven Skill Composition Architecture**. It operates as an intelligent, self-learning system that evolves from external dependency toward internal sovereignty and privacy control over time.

## Core Principles

| Principle                       | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Recipe-Driven Orchestration     | All AI behaviors are defined as modular, human-readable recipes. Recipes declare task steps, input/output, and service/tool mappings.                         |
| External Service Bootstrapping  | Initial phases leverage free-tier, trial, or paid commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Google Cloud AI) for rapid capability deployment.         |
| Adapter Layer                   | Modular connectors allow kOS to interface with any external service, tool, API, or local runtime.                                                             |
| Skill Composition               | Skills are reusable, testable units of AI logic (e.g., summarization, translation, code generation).                                                          |
| Multi-Source Input Distillation | For each user task, kOS can consult multiple LLMs, tools, and artifact sources, then distill results for better quality, creativity, and factual reliability. |
| Self-Learning                   | kOS tracks success/failure rates, latency, cost, and user feedback to optimize future task execution pathways.                                                |
| Privacy and Data Sovereignty    | System evolves towards internal hosting, encrypted storage, user data vaults, and fully decentralized deployment.                                             |
| Natural Language First UX       | Users interact with kOS via plain language conversation. The system maps user intents to recipes and orchestrates services invisibly.                         |

## System Architecture

| Layer                    | Components                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| External Services        | OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Hugging Face Inference API, Google AI tools, Slack API, etc.                                                            |
| Self-Hosted LLMs & Tools | Ollama, LocalAI, Llama.cpp, LangChain, ChromaDB, FastAPI, LlamaIndex, Weaviate, Milvus.                                                            |
| Adapter Layer            | Modular interface code translating kOS recipe calls into API or local tool invocations. Example: `OpenAIAdapter`, `SlackAdapter`, `OllamaAdapter`. |
| Skill Layer              | Unit tasks like text summarization, translation, document parsing, etc. Each adapter can provide skills.                                           |
| Recipe Layer             | Declarative YAML / JSON / NLP templates that orchestrate multiple skills into workflows.                                                           |
| Orchestration Engine     | Core kOS runtime. Parses user input → selects recipes → executes steps → manages context/state/errors.                                             |
| Meta-Learning Layer      | Tracks metrics on performance, cost, latency, and accuracy. Logs user feedback for reinforcement learning.                                         |
| Memory/Artifact Layer    | User chats, prior recipes, output history, knowledge graphs, vector DBs, user-uploaded documents.                                                  |
| UI Layer                 | Chat interface (Open WebUI, Chatbot-UI, AnythingLLM) or custom FastAPI/NLP interface.                                                              |

## Multi-Source Collaborative Response Flow

| Step | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | User submits request in natural language                                                                        |
| 2    | Orchestrator selects applicable recipe based on intent parsing                                                  |
| 3    | Recipe invokes multiple tools, models, and data sources in parallel (multi-LLM, vector search, prior chat logs) |
| 4    | Responses are tagged with source, confidence, and metadata                                                      |
| 5    | Distillation process synthesizes a unified answer, resolving conflicts and weighting source credibility         |
| 6    | For critical tasks, AI Roundtable Mode is triggered—agents engage in internal debate before final output        |
| 7    | User receives final response, with optional source traceability                                                 |

## Service Usage Strategy

| Tier                    | Priority                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Free / Trial APIs       | Highest priority for minimizing cost during bootstrapping        |
| Local Self-Hosted Tools | Used for privacy and low-cost recurring tasks                    |
| Paid APIs               | Escalation path for high-quality or high-complexity tasks        |
| User Control            | Users can set preferences for privacy, budget, source priorities |

## Example Recipe (YAML Style)

```yaml
recipe_name: summarize_pdf_and_notify_slack
steps:
  - action: extract_text_from_pdf
    tool: pdf_adapter
    input: {file_path}
  - action: summarize_text
    tool: openai_adapter
    input: {extracted_text}
  - action: format_slack_message
    tool: text_formatter
    input: {summary}
  - action: send_slack_message
    tool: slack_adapter
    input: {formatted_message}
```

---

## Adapter Interface Design

- Each Adapter exposes standardized methods:
  - **Input Mapping**
  - **Output Parsing**
  - **Error Handling**
  - **API Auth Management**
- Adapter Examples:
  - `OpenAIAdapter`
  - `AnthropicAdapter`
  - `OllamaAdapter`
  - `VectorDBAdapter`
  - `SlackAdapter`

---

## Meta-Learning Layer Responsibilities

- Track per-skill execution time, error rates, and cost
- Score API reliability vs local tool performance
- Maintain user feedback logs for supervised fine-tuning
- Suggest recipe optimizations over time

---

## Privacy and Control Roadmap

| Phase | Action                                                                 |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early | Use external APIs with user awareness                                  |
| Mid   | Begin swapping in self-hosted models for frequent tasks                |
| Late  | Fully internalize key skills and offer user-configurable privacy modes |

---

## AI Roundtable Auditing Logic

For high-risk or fact-sensitive tasks:

- kOS triggers internal debate between AI sources
- Agents present reasoning and evidence
- System selects most consistent, factual, and defensible output
- Optionally, user can view full AI Roundtable transcript

---

## Next Development Steps for Agents

- Finalize Recipe Registry schema
- Build Adapter Templates for top external APIs
- Develop Multi-Source Distillation Module
- Create initial Recipe Library (10–20 starter recipes)
- Deploy logging and meta-learning scaffolds
- Design basic UI/UX with Natural Language Conversation support
- Integrate artifact history and chat memory indexing
