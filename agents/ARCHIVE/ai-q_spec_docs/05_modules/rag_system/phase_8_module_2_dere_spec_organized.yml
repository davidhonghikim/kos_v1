# Phase 8 Module Specification – Module 2: DERE (Dynamic Entity Runtime Engine)

## Module Name

**DERE – Dynamic Entity Runtime Engine**

## Purpose

DERE serves as the central execution and lifecycle manager for all active agents and entities within the kOS ecosystem. It handles the real-time instantiation, scheduling, resource allocation, state management, and teardown of all runtime entities. It ensures that agents operate within assigned resources, comply with system health rules, and remain responsive under varying load conditions.

## Functional Overview

### Primary Functions:

1. **Dynamic Entity Orchestration**

   - Real-time instantiation and destruction of agent instances (soft and hard instantiation modes)
   - Entity state suspension, hibernation, or rehydration on demand

2. **Resource Allocation and Throttling**

   - Dynamic CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage allocation per entity
   - Auto-throttling during high load conditions

3. **Execution Scheduling**

   - Task queue management
   - Priority-based scheduling (supports real-time and batch modes)
   - Micro-task and macro-task balancing

4. **Health Monitoring and Auto-Recovery**

   - Per-entity heartbeat tracking
   - Crash detection and auto-respawn mechanisms
   - Isolation of unstable or misbehaving entities

5. **Context Preservation**

   - Checkpointing and state snapshots for long-running agents
   - Hot migration support between nodes in distributed deployments

## Detailed Module Architecture

### Input Channels:

- Execution requests from kOS Orchestrator
- Resource usage feedback from ARC (Adaptive Resource Controller)
- System health telemetry from OMNI
- Task assignments from FRACTAL

### Output Channels:

- Execution state updates to Orchestrator and OMNI
- Resource adjustment signals to ARC
- Entity state logs to storage
- Failure and error events to VESPER

### Core Components:

| Component                          | Description                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity Lifecycle Manager (ELM)** | Manages start, pause, resume, and terminate states for all agents   |
| **Resource Manager (RM)**          | Allocates and scales resources per agent based on load and priority |
| **Scheduler Engine (SE)**          | Runs task queues and prioritizes execution order                    |
| **Health Monitor (HM)**            | Tracks agent responsiveness, health status, and crash events        |
| **State Preservation Layer (SPL)** | Handles state snapshots, checkpointing, and context rehydration     |
| **Migration Controller (MC)**      | Orchestrates entity migration between nodes                         |

## Key Algorithms and Processes

1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation Algorithm (DRAA)**

   - Inputs: Entity profile, system load, historical resource usage
   - Output: Resource allocation profile per agent

2. **Priority-Aware Scheduling Algorithm (PASA)**

   - Factors: Execution priority, deadline sensitivity, entity health, resource availability
   - Supports preemption and fairness balancing

3. **Crash Detection and Auto-Respawn (CDAR)**

   - Monitors heartbeat signals and failure logs
   - Defines auto-restart thresholds and back-off timers

4. **Context Snapshot and Rehydration (CSR)**

   - Periodic state capture
   - Enables restart from latest checkpoint

5. **Hot Migration Protocol (HMP)**

   - Transfers state, resource lock info, and execution pointer to target node
   - Ensures minimal execution downtime

## API Endpoints (Internal to kOS)

| Endpoint                 | Method | Description                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/dere/spawn_entity`     | POST   | Request creation of a new runtime entity     |
| `/dere/terminate_entity` | POST   | Terminate a specified entity                 |
| `/dere/entity_status`    | GET    | Fetch status of an active entity             |
| `/dere/snapshot_state`   | POST   | Trigger manual state checkpoint              |
| `/dere/migrate_entity`   | POST   | Initiate migration of entity to another node |
| `/dere/scale_resources`  | POST   | Request resource reallocation                |

## Dependencies

- **ARC (Adaptive Resource Controller)**
- **OMNI (Operational Metrics and Node Intelligence)**
- **VESPER (Verification and Protection Layer)**
- **kOS Messaging Bus**
- **Persistent Storage Backend for state checkpoints**

---

## Deployment Considerations

- Must be optimized for low-latency execution management
- Horizontal scalability required for large multi-node environments
- Requires tight coupling with ARC and OMNI for feedback-driven control loops
- Should run with elevated process isolation to prevent entity corruption

---

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- Unit and integration tests for all lifecycle states
- Load tests with thousands of simultaneous entities
- Crash and recovery scenario simulations
- Resource starvation edge-case tests
- Hot migration under network disruption scenarios

---

## Future Extensions

- ML-driven resource prediction for proactive scaling
- Distributed, decentralized scheduling for multi-datacenter deployment
- Entity cloning for rapid parallelization
