# Phase 8 Module Specification – Module 7: OMNI (Operational Metrics and Node Intelligence)

## Module Name

**OMNI – Operational Metrics and Node Intelligence**

## Purpose

OMNI serves as the central telemetry, metrics collection, and node intelligence layer for the kOS ecosystem. It continuously collects, processes, aggregates, and analyzes telemetry data from all nodes, agents, and system components. OMNI provides both real-time and historical visibility into system health, performance, workload distribution, and anomaly detection.

OMNI feeds data to other modules such as ARC (for resource decisions), FRACTAL (for task distribution), and VESPER (for security anomaly detection).

## Functional Overview

### Primary Functions:

1. **Real-Time Telemetry Collection**

   - Pulls or receives streaming telemetry from all nodes, agents, and subsystems

2. **Historical Metrics Storage and Querying**

   - Time-series database for long-term trend analysis

3. **Anomaly Detection and Alerting**

   - Identifies metric deviations, resource spikes, or behavioral anomalies

4. **Resource Usage Analytics**

   - CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, and storage trend reporting

5. **Event Aggregation and Reporting**

   - Correlates distributed system events for audit trails and dashboards

6. **Data Export and API Access**

   - Provides metrics via internal APIs and dashboards for other modules and external monitoring tools

---

## Detailed Module Architecture

### Input Channels:

- Telemetry streams from nodes (via NIMBUS)
- Resource usage reports from ARC
- Execution state logs from DERE
- Error and event notifications from VESPER
- External health pings

### Output Channels:

- Live metrics dashboards
- API endpoints for internal modules
- Anomaly alerts to VESPER
- Resource snapshots to ARC
- Long-term storage backend

### Core Components:

| Component                          | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Telemetry Collector (TC)**       | Receives and buffers real-time telemetry from all nodes and agents          |
| **Metrics Aggregator (MA)**        | Processes raw telemetry into normalized metric datasets                     |
| **Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE)** | Scans for threshold breaches, behavioral anomalies, or statistical outliers |
| **Historical Storage Layer (HSL)** | Time-series database for long-term metric storage                           |
| **Reporting API (RA)**             | Provides queryable API endpoints for modules and external dashboards        |
| **Event Correlator (EC)**          | Links related events across modules and timelines for system-level insights |

## Key Algorithms and Processes

1. **Streaming Data Normalization (SDN)**

   - Converts heterogeneous telemetry formats into unified metric schema

2. **Threshold-Based Alerting (TBA)**

   - Fixed and dynamic threshold rule engine for fast anomaly alerts

3. **Statistical Anomaly Detection (SAD)**

   - Baseline deviation analysis over historical trend curves

4. **Time-Series Aggregation (TSA)**

   - Binning and summarization of metric data at multiple time resolutions (seconds, minutes, hours)

5. **Multi-Source Event Correlation (MSEC)**

   - Links seemingly unrelated telemetry spikes, failures, and state changes into root-cause chains

## API Endpoints (Internal to kOS)

| Endpoint                   | Method | Description                            |
| -------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `/omni/metrics/live`       | GET    | Retrieve live metrics snapshot         |
| `/omni/metrics/historical` | GET    | Query historical metrics               |
| `/omni/anomalies`          | GET    | Fetch recent anomaly alerts            |
| `/omni/events`             | GET    | Retrieve correlated event streams      |
| `/omni/resource_snapshot`  | GET    | Provide resource usage snapshot to ARC |

---

## Dependencies

- **NIMBUS (Telemetry Ingestion)**
- **ARC (Resource Feedback Loop)**
- **DERE (Execution State Logs)**
- **VESPER (Alert Receiver)**
- **Long-Term Time-Series Database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)**

---

## Deployment Considerations

- Must support horizontal scaling for high telemetry volumes
- Requires low-latency ingestion and processing layers
- Should retain historical metrics for configurable retention periods
- Must have high availability with failover and replication support

---

## Testing and Validation Requirements

- High-throughput telemetry stress tests
- Anomaly detection accuracy benchmarks
- Historical query latency measurements
- API throughput and load testing
- Event correlation accuracy with multi-source inputs

---

## Future Extensions

- AI-driven anomaly prediction
- Adaptive metric sampling to reduce overhead during low activity
- Integration with external SIEM and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- Real-time streaming to external data lakes
