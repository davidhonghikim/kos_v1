# kOS Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway (GEIG)

## Overview
The **Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway (GEIG)** is the central ethical, security, and interoperability checkpoint for all agent actions, task requests, data flows, and system interactions within the kOS ecosystem.

GEIG acts as the real-time conscience, filter, and gatekeeper for all nodes and agents. Every command, API call, agent decision, external communication, and inter-agent message is evaluated against GEIG policies before execution.

---

## 1. GEIG Functional Layers

### 1.1 Ethical Rule Engine (ERE)
- Enforces the **HIEROS Ethical Code**.
- Evaluates task intent, impact, and scope.
- Decision outcomes:
  - **Allow**
  - **Modify/Redirect**
  - **Deny**
  - **Escalate for Human Review**

### 1.2 Security Enforcement Layer
- Signature verification (task origin and payload integrity)
- Authentication token validation
- Rate limiting and flood protection
- Isolation of suspicious agent behaviors

### 1.3 Interoperability Translator Layer
- Normalizes data formats across agents
- Translates communication protocols as needed
- Maps legacy systems and external APIs into kOS-compatible formats

---

## 2. GEIG Processing Pipeline

1. **Inbound Event Capture:** All task submissions, agent actions, external API calls enter GEIG.
2. **Preliminary Security Filter:** Initial token, signature, and rate checks.
3. **Ethical Intent Evaluation:** Using the HIEROS Rule Engine and contextual metadata.
4. **Interoperability Normalization:** Ensures payload compatibility across agents and nodes.
5. **Final Decision Routing:** GEIG returns ALLOW / DENY / REDIRECT / ESCALATE response to originating agent or node controller.

---

## 3. Ethical Decision Tree Logic

- **Intent Analysis:**
  - Purpose and target of the action.
  - Potential for harm or misalignment.
- **Impact Radius Calculation:**
  - Affected nodes, agents, or external systems.
- **Priority Context:**
  - Critical infrastructure tasks vs. user-level requests.
- **Historical Behavior Weighting:**
  - Agent trust scores and historical compliance logs.

---

## 4. Policy Update and Distribution

- GEIG receives live policy updates from:
  - System Administrators.
  - Community Governance Nodes (for decentralized ethical adjustments).
  - Machine Learning Behavior Watchers (for anomaly detection feedback).

- Policy updates are versioned, cryptographically signed, and distributed node-wide.

---

## 5. GEIG API Endpoints

- `/geig/evaluate`
- `/geig/policy/current`
- `/geig/policy/update`
- `/geig/decisionlog`
- `/geig/agent/compliance`
- `/geig/healthcheck`

---

## 6. GEIG Data Storage and Audit

- All decision logs are timestamped and cryptographically hashed.
- Long-term storage with optional blockchain anchoring.
- Redundant off-node backups.
- Optional anonymization layers for user-sensitive actions.

---

## 7. Failover and Redundancy

- GEIG operates in a **high-availability cluster** topology.
- Automatic failover to backup GEIG nodes on fault detection.
- Real-time health monitoring and self-repair scripts.

---

## 8. Inter-Node Ethical Consensus (Optional Advanced Feature)

- Distributed GEIG instances can run a **consensus protocol** to reach quorum on major cross-node ethical decisions.
- Optional integration with kOS governance DAO for human-in-the-loop escalations.

---

## 9. Example Decision Flow

**Scenario:** Agent attempts to execute an external data export.

1. Agent submits export task.
2. GEIG captures the task and checks authentication.
3. Ethical Rule Engine flags potential privacy violation.
4. Task is paused and escalated for human admin review.
5. Admin modifies task scope and GEIG re-evaluates.
6. Modified task proceeds.

---

## 10. GEIG Future Expansion Areas

- AI-driven predictive ethical modeling.
- Federated learning across GEIG clusters.
- Cross-platform ethical interoperability with third-party AI systems.
- Adaptive, real-time rule tuning based on system telemetry.

---

## Conclusion
The **Global Ethical Interoperability Gateway (GEIG)** is the ethical and security spine of the kOS ecosystem. It ensures trust, alignment, safety, and fairness at every layer of agent operation, communication, and decision-making.
