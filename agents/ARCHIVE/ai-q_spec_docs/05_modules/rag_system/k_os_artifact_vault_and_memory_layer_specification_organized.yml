# kOS Artifact Vault and Memory Layer Specification

## Overview

The **Artifact Vault and Memory Layer** serves as the **long-term knowledge repository** and **short-term operational memory** for the entire kOS ecosystem. It stores all artifacts, conversations, logs, context graphs, documents, execution traces, and learning data produced or consumed by kOS agents.

This layer is critical for supporting **contextual continuity**, **user memory**, **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** workflows, **agent learning**, and **multi-step task management**.

---

## Core Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| **Artifact Storage** | Persistently store all knowledge outputs (summaries, code, reports, transcripts, embeddings, etc.). |
| **Session Memory** | Maintain short-term conversational context for multi-turn user interactions. |
| **Execution Logs** | Archive full recipe and skill execution traces for auditing and learning. |
| **User Uploads** | Securely store user-uploaded documents, files, and data inputs for future use. |
| **Embedding Store** | Maintain vector representations of artifacts for fast similarity search and semantic retrieval (for RAG). |
| **Knowledge Graphs** | Generate and maintain structured semantic graphs linking entities, topics, and events. |
| **Access Control** | Enforce user-defined permissions and privacy settings for all stored content. |
| **Data Retention Policies** | Support user-configurable retention, deletion, and archiving policies. |

---

## Storage Components

| Component | Function |
|---|---|
| **Short-Term Memory Store** | Holds active session data, recent conversation turns, and temporary variables. |
| **Long-Term Artifact Vault** | Durable storage for all artifacts, knowledge outputs, user documents, and chat logs. |
| **Vector Embedding DB** | Stores vectorized content for semantic search and RAG operations (ChromaDB, Weaviate, etc.). |
| **Execution Log Archive** | Records all recipe, skill, and agent execution histories. |
| **Knowledge Graph Store** | Maintains structured ontologies, entity links, and topic maps derived from artifacts and user interactions. |

---

## Supported Storage Backends

| Storage Type | Options |
|---|---|
| File-Based | YAML, JSON, CSV, Markdown, or flat files for local deployments. |
| Relational DB | SQLite, DuckDB, PostgreSQL for structured storage needs. |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant for semantic search and RAG pipelines. |
| Object Storage | MinIO, S3-compatible storage for large file and artifact handling. |

---

## Data Flow Example: User Upload → Memory → Retrieval

1. **User uploads a PDF document.**
2. **kOS extracts text → stores raw file + parsed text as an artifact.**
3. **Text is embedded and saved in the Vector DB.**
4. **Metadata is linked in the Knowledge Graph Store.**
5. **When user later asks about that topic, kOS retrieves relevant snippets via semantic search.**

---

## Privacy & Data Sovereignty

| Policy | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| **User Ownership** | Users fully own and control their stored data. |
| **Encryption at Rest** | All Vault data is encrypted on disk. |
| **Selective Sharing** | Users control which artifacts, if any, are shared with external nodes (federated learning opt-in). |
| **Data Portability** | Users can export their entire memory and vault contents at any time. |
| **Right to Forget** | Users can delete any part of their memory, permanently. |

---

## Extensibility

| Future Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Federated Memory Sharing | Optional peer-to-peer knowledge sharing between nodes. |
| Temporal Memory Decay | Support forgetting low-value artifacts over time (user-configurable). |
| Meta-Tagging Engine | Auto-categorize and tag artifacts for faster retrieval. |
| Knowledge Replay Tools | Let users replay past sessions or artifact histories for reflection or learning. |

---

## Next Steps for Development

- Implement Short-Term Memory Manager.
- Build Artifact Vault API with CRUD operations.
- Integrate Vector Store (ChromaDB/Weaviate).
- Develop Knowledge Graph Generator module.
- Create User Data Export and Deletion tools.
- Connect Artifact Vault to Orchestration Engine and Recipe Layer.
