# kOS Memory Node Class Specification

## Overview
The **kOS Memory Node Class** acts as the data persistence, long-term storage, and knowledge retention layer of the kOS ecosystem. Memory Nodes manage storage, indexing, and retrieval of both structured and unstructured data, supporting both agent-level short-term memory and system-wide long-term knowledge archives.

Memory Nodes form the ecosystem’s "memory banks," enabling recall, learning, historical analysis, and state continuity across agents and nodes.

---

## 1. Primary Roles and Functions

- Long-term data storage and archiving
- Short-term, high-speed agent memory caching
- Knowledge Graph persistence (via KGOML)
- Telemetry, task history, and audit log storage
- Vector storage for AI embedding queries
- Backup and disaster recovery coordination

---

## 2. Standard Agent Types within Memory Nodes

- **Data Ingestion Agents**
- **Indexing and Search Agents**
- **Memory Retrieval Agents**
- **Backup Management Agents**
- **Data Aging and Cleanup Agents**

---

## 3. Internal Architecture

### 3.1 Storage Engine Layer
- Supports multi-type storage backends:
  - Object storage (S3, MinIO)
  - Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
  - Time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
  - Vector databases (Weaviate, Milvus, etc.)

### 3.2 Data Access API Layer
- Provides standardized CRUD operations
- Supports batch and streaming data access
- GEIG-governed query filters for ethical data retrieval

### 3.3 Indexing and Search Engine
- Full-text search support
- Vector-based semantic search
- Metadata-based query optimization

### 3.4 Backup and Recovery Module
- Scheduled and on-demand backups
- Distributed snapshot support
- Incremental backup capabilities

---

## 4. Ethical and Security Safeguards

- GEIG-mandated privacy and retention policies
- Data access role validation
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access logs for every read, write, or delete operation

---

## 5. Performance and Scaling

- Sharding support for large-scale data sets
- Horizontal scaling of storage and index nodes
- Caching layers for high-frequency read/write workloads
- Distributed query execution for large data scans

---

## 6. Monitoring and Reporting

- Storage utilization dashboards
- Query latency metrics
- Backup success/failure reporting
- Data ingestion rate visualizers

---

## 7. Advanced Features

- AI-driven data retention policy optimization
- Federated memory sync across clusters
- Auto-indexing for frequently accessed query patterns
- Real-time vector similarity search for AI agents

---

## Conclusion
The **kOS Memory Node Class** ensures that the entire ecosystem retains, manages, and safeguards its collective knowledge, state histories, and agent memories—enabling intelligent recall, ethical storage practices, and high-performance data access across all kOS operations.

Next Step: Proceeding to the **Ethics Node Class** specification.
