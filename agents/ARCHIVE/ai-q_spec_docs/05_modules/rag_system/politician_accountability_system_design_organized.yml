# Public Accountability & Transparency Platform (PATP) - Full System Design & Overview

## Project Overview

### Purpose:
To build a large-scale, real-time, open-source, AI-powered public accountability platform that catalogs, cross-references, analyzes, and gamifies all public individuals and entities across various sectors (politics, business, media, organizations). The goal is to create a single public memory and accountability system to track words vs. actions, financial influences, social networks, and integrity at all levels.

## High-Level System Architecture

### Layers:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer (ETL)**
2. **Data Storage Layer (Databases & File Stores)**
3. **AI/ML Processing Layer**
4. **API Layer (Internal & External)**
5. **Frontend / UI Layer**
6. **Gamification & Engagement Layer**
7. **Security & Governance Layer**
8. **Community & Crowdsourcing Layer**
9. **Observability, Monitoring & DevOps Layer**

---

## Detailed Component Breakdown

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer (ETL)
- **Sources:** Government portals, corporate disclosures, news APIs, social media, NGO databases, public statements, regulatory filings.
- **Tools:** Python, Apache Airflow, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Puppeteer.
- **Functions:**
  - Scheduled scraping and API pulls
  - Change tracking for source schema shifts
  - Data cleaning and normalization
  - Failure recovery for scrape errors

### 2. Data Storage Layer
- **Relational DB (PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB):**
  - Individual and organizational profiles
  - Public actions and records
  - Financial transactions
  - Community user accounts

- **Document Store (S3 / MinIO / MongoDB GridFS):**
  - Speech transcripts
  - Regulatory documents
  - News articles
  - Uploaded user reports

- **Graph Database (Neo4j):**
  - Relationships between individuals, donors, lobbyists, corporations, organizations, activities

- **Vector Database (Weaviate / ChromaDB):**
  - Semantic embeddings of speeches, documents for NLP querying

### 3. AI/ML Processing Layer
- **Pipelines:**
  - Speech-to-Text (Whisper, DeepSpeech)
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Hugging Face Transformers
  - Contradiction Detection Model (LLM with RAG pipelines)
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Financial Anomaly Detection
  - Promise Tracker
  - Behavior Anomaly Detection across any public entity

- **Training Data:**
  - Historical public datasets
  - Labeled contradictions and misalignment examples
  - Financial and behavioral patterns

### 4. API Layer
- **Internal API (FastAPI / Node.js):**
  - For frontend/backend communication
  - Microservices: Profile Service, Financial Service, Activity Service, AI Service

- **Public API:**
  - REST & GraphQL endpoints for external devs
  - Rate-limiting & API key management
  - Public data query interface

- **Streaming/Webhooks:**
  - For real-time updates (new records, statements, financial disclosures)

### 5. Frontend / UI Layer
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS
- **Components:**
  - Search and Filter UI
  - Public Profile Pages
  - Action Records Viewer
  - Financial Source Viewer
  - Speech and Statement Archive
  - Contradiction Feed
  - Leaderboards (Integrity, Influence, Activity, etc.)
  - Gamified XP / Badges / Achievements
  - Network Graph Visualizations
  - Public Submission Forms

### 6. Gamification & Engagement Layer
- **Entity Card Generator:** Dynamic generation based on live stats
- **XP & Level System:** Calculated from transparency, engagement, behavioral consistency
- **Leaderboards:** Top Honest, Most Influential, Most Contradictions
- **Badges:** Accountability Achievements for entities and users
- **Fantasy League Module (Phase 2+):** Draft entities, track real-world score

### 7. Security & Governance Layer
- **Data Provenance Tracking:** Immutable record of all source origins
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** For internal admins and moderators
- **Content Moderation Tools:** Human-in-the-loop approval for user submissions
- **API Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection:** Throttle abusers, prevent scraping
- **Ethics & Bias Audits:** Scheduled review of AI decision fairness
- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance:** User data protections
- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Nightly backups, failover readiness

### 8. Community & Crowdsourcing Layer
- **Crowd Fact Checking:** User-submitted contradiction reports
- **Tip Submission Portal:** For insider leaks, document uploads
- **Entity Trustworthiness Voting:** Public sentiment scoring
- **Community Challenges:** Weekly fact-checking or report validation quests
- **User XP System:** Reward user engagement with points and badges

### 9. Observability, Monitoring & DevOps Layer
- **Logging:** Full-stack logs
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes-ready
- **Load Testing:** K6, Locust
- **Alerting:** PagerDuty / Slack integration for failure events
- **Auto-Scaling:** Kubernetes HPA or similar service

---

## Future Optional Modules
- **Immutable Blockchain-backed Ledger:** For action and data integrity audits
- **AI-Powered Entity Recommendation Tool:** Personalized monitoring guidance
- **Cross-National Module:** Expand beyond the U.S. to global entities
- **Web3 Reward Layer:** Tokenize public engagement (optional)

---

## Governance / Legal / Ethical Notes
- No private citizen data collection without consent
- Full data source transparency
- Optional open source licensing (GPL, AGPL, or MIT)
- Whistleblower protection policies
- Public ethical governance board (for bias audits and oversight)

---

## Next Steps for Build Teams:
1. Finalize database schemas
2. Draft OpenAPI spec
3. Build ETL pipelines for top 5 public data sources
4. Launch first entity profile MVP
5. Expand to cross-sector and cross-national datasets
6. Integrate first AI models
7. Launch public beta
