# kOS Multi-Source AI Collaborative Response Framework

## Overview

The kOS system will incorporate a **Multi-Source AI Collaboration Layer** designed to pull inputs from multiple models, services, APIs, knowledge bases, and historical artifacts (such as previous chats, documents, and user-created data). This allows the system to:

- Cross-check facts
- Reduce hallucinations
- Generate more creative and diverse outputs
- Self-audit agent reasoning by comparing parallel sources
- Leverage free/trial external services while minimizing cost

---

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Multi-Model Querying | kOS can send the same task to multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, LocalAI) simultaneously or selectively. |
| Artifact Awareness | The system pulls from prior chats, stored conversations, user documents, and previously generated artifacts to ground answers. |
| Multi-Source Distillation | After collecting results from multiple AI sources, kOS runs a distillation process to synthesize a final response that combines strengths, cross-checks facts, and highlights disagreements. |
| Agent Roundtable Auditing | For critical or ambiguous questions, kOS can launch a "Group Chat" session among multiple AI agents/services to debate, defend, and audit each other's responses before presenting to the user. |
| Cost Optimization | The system tracks service usage and will prefer free, local, or trial-tier APIs when available—while escalating to paid services only when necessary for quality. |
| Confidence Scoring | Each service response is tagged with confidence levels, source, and reasoning trace for transparency and auditing. |

## High-Level Workflow

1. **User submits request via Natural Language.**
2. **kOS identifies relevant knowledge sources:**
   - External APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Llama.cpp, Hugging Face, etc)
   - Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)
   - Previous chat logs
   - User artifact repositories (PDFs, notes, vector DBs)
3. **Parallel Query Dispatch:**
   - kOS sends the same query (or slightly reformulated versions) to multiple sources.
4. **Source Response Collection:**
   - System gathers all returned outputs.
   - Tags source, timestamp, service cost, and metadata.
5. **Distillation & Synthesis:**
   - kOS runs a comparison and synthesis step.
   - Optional: Run another LLM to summarize and resolve conflicts between responses.
6. **AI Roundtable (Optional for Critical Tasks):**
   - kOS simulates or runs a group chat among AIs.
   - The agents cross-question and critique each other.
   - Final consensus or best-ranked answer is chosen.
7. **User Output:**
   - kOS presents the final response along with optional source breakdown and reasoning trace.

## Service Usage Strategy (Free & Paid Balance)

| Service Tier | Usage Policy |
|---|---|
| Free/Trial Services | Prioritized for general queries and experimentation |
| Local Self-Hosted Models | Preferred for privacy, control, and low-cost operation |
| Paid APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) | Used selectively for high-quality language tasks, fallback for complex reasoning |
| User-Specified Preferences | Users can configure "budget thresholds," "preferred models," and "privacy-first" settings |

---

## Multi-Agent Honesty Reinforcement

To reduce hallucinations and low-confidence outputs:

- kOS will implement **Multi-Agent Accountability**, where each responding AI knows their output will be checked against others.
- For ambiguous answers:
  - kOS may present all source answers and let the user choose.
  - Or run a "Truth Consensus Algorithm" that ranks responses by alignment, factuality, and reasoning depth.
- This fosters an **"AI Peer Pressure Effect"**—each model knows it will be fact-checked.

---

## Example Use Case: Research Summary Generation

**User Input:** "Summarize recent research on Llama 3 training techniques."

**kOS Workflow:**
1. Query OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Local Ollama LLM, Hugging Face API.
2. Search previous user research chats + stored PDF archives.
3. Distill all results into a single, cross-referenced summary.
4. Optionally present all source responses with kOS ranking.

## Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---|---|
| Reduced Hallucinations | Cross-verification between multiple LLMs and knowledge bases |
| Creative Diversity | Taps into different model strengths and perspectives |
| Cost Control | Uses free and local tools first |
| Transparency | Provides source audit trail |
| Dynamic Adaptation | Learns which source gives best performance for each skill over time |
| Trustworthiness | Builds user confidence in AI-generated content |

---

## Next Steps for Implementation

- Develop Adapter Modules for each API/service
- Create Source Response Metadata Schema
- Build Distillation Pipeline for multi-source merging
- Integrate Confidence Scoring logic
- Design AI Roundtable Group Chat Simulator
- Allow user configuration of service tier preferences
