  title: Overview
  type: section
  content: Task Scheduling modules manage the prioritization, timing, and resource
    allocation for tasks within workflows. They ensure that all tasks are executed
    efficiently, on time, and according to system policies and constraints.
- level: 2
  title: Core Principles
  type: section
  content: '- **Efficiency**: Maximize throughput and minimize idle time

    - **Fairness**: Ensure equitable resource allocation

    - **Scalability**: Handle large numbers of tasks and schedules

    - **Adaptability**: Adjust to changing workloads and priorities

    - **Reliability**: Guarantee task execution even under failure conditions'

  title: Base Functions
  type: section
  content: '1. **Task Queue Management** – Manage queues of pending and active tasks

    2. **Priority Scheduling** – Assign and enforce task priorities

    3. **Deadline Enforcement** – Ensure tasks meet required deadlines

    4. **Resource Allocation** – Allocate CPU, memory, and other resources

    5. **Task Dependencies** – Manage dependencies between tasks

    6. **Retry & Backoff** – Handle failed tasks with retry and backoff strategies

    7. **Scheduling Policies** – Support multiple scheduling algorithms (FIFO, LIFO,
    priority, etc.)

    8. **Task Cancellation** – Allow tasks to be cancelled or preempted'

  title: Capabilities
  type: section
  content: '- **Time-based Scheduling**: Cron, interval, and event-based triggers

    - **Priority & Deadline Management**: Enforce priorities and deadlines

    - **Resource-aware Scheduling**: Allocate resources based on availability

    - **Dependency Resolution**: Ensure tasks run in correct order

    - **Failure Recovery**: Retry and reschedule failed tasks'

  title: Configuration Example
  type: section
  content: "```yaml\ntask_scheduler:\n  type: \"priority\"\n  max_concurrent_tasks:\
    \ 100\n  default_priority: 5\n  deadline_enforcement: true\n  retry:\n    attempts:\
    \ 2\n    backoff: \"linear\"\n  resource_limits:\n    cpu: \"2\"\n    memory:\
    \ \"4Gi\"\n  policies:\n    - name: \"fifo\"\n      enabled: true\n    - name:\
    \ \"priority\"\n      enabled: true\n```"
- level: 2
  title: Error Handling
  type: section
  content: '- **Queue Overflows**: Drop or delay tasks, alert operators

    - **Missed Deadlines**: Escalate or reschedule tasks

    - **Resource Exhaustion**: Throttle or reject new tasks

    - **Dependency Failures**: Block dependent tasks and log errors

    - **Policy Violations**: Log and revert to default scheduling policy'
- level: 2
  title: Usage Scenarios
  type: section
  content: '- Scheduling jobs in distributed systems

    - Managing task dependencies and priorities

    - Enforcing SLAs and deadlines'
- level: 2
  title: Future Expansion
  type: section
  content: Support for advanced scheduling algorithms, predictive scheduling, and
    integration with external schedulers will be added as needed.
