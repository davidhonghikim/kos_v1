  title: Overview
  type: section
  content: Workflow Engines are responsible for the orchestration, scheduling, and
    execution of complex, multi-step processes within the kOS modular architecture.
    They provide the backbone for reliable, scalable, and flexible workflow execution
    across distributed systems.
- level: 2
  title: Core Principles
  type: section
  content: '- **Reliability**: Ensure workflows execute to completion and recover
    from failures

    - **Extensibility**: Support plug-in modules and custom workflow logic

    - **Performance**: Optimize for high-throughput and low-latency execution

    - **Observability**: Provide detailed monitoring and logging of workflow execution

    - **Configurability**: Allow dynamic workflow definitions and runtime adjustments'

- level: 3
  title: Base Functions
  type: section
  content: '1. **Engine Initialization** – Initialize workflow engine state and resources

    2. **Workflow Parsing** – Parse workflow definitions and validate structure

    3. **State Management** – Track workflow and task state throughout execution

    4. **Task Dispatching** – Assign and trigger tasks within the workflow

    5. **Error Handling** – Detect, log, and recover from workflow errors

    6. **Workflow Persistence** – Persist workflow state for recovery and auditing

    7. **Engine Monitoring** – Monitor engine health, performance, and events

    8. **Extensibility Hooks** – Support for custom modules and extensions'

  title: Capabilities
  type: section
  content: '- **Dynamic Workflow Loading**: Load and execute workflows at runtime

    - **Parallel & Sequential Execution**: Support both execution patterns

    - **Stateful Recovery**: Resume workflows after failure or restart

    - **Custom Logic Integration**: Plug in custom modules for specialized tasks

    - **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Expose metrics and logs for all workflow events'

  title: Configuration Example
  type: section
  content: "```yaml\nworkflow_engine:\n  type: \"sequential\"\n  max_concurrent_workflows:\
    \ 20\n  state_persistence: true\n  error_handling:\n    retry_attempts: 3\n  \
    \  backoff_strategy: \"exponential\"\n  monitoring:\n    enabled: true\n    metrics:\
    \ [\"latency\", \"throughput\", \"failures\"]\n  extensions:\n    - name: \"custom_logger\"\
    \n      enabled: true\n```"
- level: 2
  title: Error Handling
  type: section
  content: '- **Initialization Failures**: Log and abort engine startup

    - **Parsing Errors**: Reject invalid workflow definitions with detailed errors

    - **Task Dispatch Failures**: Retry or escalate based on policy

    - **Persistence Errors**: Fallback to in-memory state and alert operators

    - **Monitoring Gaps**: Self-diagnose and attempt to restart monitoring modules'

  title: Usage Scenarios
  type: section
  content: '- Orchestrating multi-step business processes

    - Integrating with external workflow systems

    - Dynamic workflow composition and execution'
- level: 2
  title: Future Expansion
  type: section
  content: Additional modules and advanced features (e.g., adaptive workflow engines,
    AI-driven orchestration) will be added as requirements evolve.
