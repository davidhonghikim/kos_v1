  title: '**Overview**'
  type: section
  content: The Event Driven Workflow Engine module provides event-driven orchestration
    capabilities, triggering and executing workflows based on real-time events, triggers,
    and external signals. It supports reactive programming patterns, event sourcing,
    and real-time workflow orchestration for dynamic, responsive systems.
- level: 2
  title: '**Core Principles**'
  type: section
  content: '- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Trigger workflows based on events and
    triggers.

    - **Real-Time Responsiveness**: React to events with minimal latency.

    - **Event Sourcing**: Maintain complete event history for audit and replay.

    - **Reactive Programming**: Support reactive patterns and event streams.'
