  title: Overview
  type: section
  content: Process Management modules handle the lifecycle, monitoring, and control
    of processes within workflows. They ensure robust execution, isolation, and recovery
    of workflow steps, supporting both short-lived and long-running processes.
- level: 2
  title: Core Principles
  type: section
  content: '- **Robustness**: Ensure processes are resilient to failure

    - **Isolation**: Prevent interference between processes

    - **Scalability**: Support dynamic scaling of process pools

    - **Transparency**: Provide clear monitoring and logging

    - **Recoverability**: Enable automatic and manual recovery of failed processes'

  title: Base Functions
  type: section
  content: '1. **Process Creation** – Instantiate new processes for workflow steps

    2. **Process Monitoring** – Track process health, status, and resource usage

    3. **Process Control** – Pause, resume, or terminate processes as needed

    4. **Process Termination** – Cleanly shut down processes and release resources

    5. **Process Recovery** – Restart or recover failed processes

    6. **Process Logging** – Log process events and errors

    7. **Process Isolation** – Enforce boundaries between processes

    8. **Process Scaling** – Dynamically adjust the number of active processes'

  title: Capabilities
  type: section
  content: '- **Health Monitoring**: Track and report process health

    - **Dynamic Scaling**: Adjust process pools based on workload

    - **Automatic Recovery**: Restart failed processes automatically

    - **Comprehensive Logging**: Record all process events and errors

    - **Resource Management**: Allocate and reclaim resources efficiently'

    \ 50\n    idle_timeout: 300s\n  monitoring:\n    health_check_interval: 30s\n\
    \    metrics_collection: true\n    alerting: true\n  recovery:\n    auto_restart:\
    \ true\n    max_restarts: 3\n    restart_delay: 10s\n```"

  title: Error Handling
  type: section
  content: '- **Process Failures**: Detect and recover failed processes

    - **Resource Leaks**: Monitor and reclaim unused resources

    - **Scaling Errors**: Log and alert on scaling issues

    - **Isolation Breaches**: Enforce boundaries and log violations

    - **Logging Failures**: Fallback to alternate logging mechanisms'
- level: 2
  title: Usage Scenarios
  type: section
  content: '- Managing long-running or stateful processes

    - Ensuring process isolation and recovery

    - Scaling workflow execution dynamically'
- level: 2
  title: Future Expansion
  type: section
  content: Future modules may include advanced process orchestration, AI-driven process
    management, and integration with external process managers.
