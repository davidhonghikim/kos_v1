  content: '**For AI Agents**: This is your NEW organized navigation hub. The system
    is now logically structured with numbered subdirectories for easy navigation.
    Start with 01_core for essential rules, then follow the numbered progression based
    on your needs.


    **Implementation Notes**: Complete reorganization from flat numbered files to
    logical subdirectory structure. All redundancy eliminated, single source of truth
    established.

    **Quality Requirements**: Follow core rules in 01_core. Use quality standards
    from 04_quality for all work.

    **Integration Points**: Connects to all numbered subdirectories with clear purpose
    separation.
