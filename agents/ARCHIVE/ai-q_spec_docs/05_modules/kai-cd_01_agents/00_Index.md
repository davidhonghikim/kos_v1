# Agent Documentation System 🏗️

**Master navigation for comprehensively organized AI agent collaboration system**

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: This is your NEW organized navigation hub. The system is now logically structured with numbered subdirectories for easy navigation. Start with 01_core for essential rules, then follow the numbered progression based on your needs.

**Implementation Notes**: Complete reorganization from flat numbered files to logical subdirectory structure. All redundancy eliminated, single source of truth established.
**Quality Requirements**: Follow core rules in 01_core. Use quality standards from 04_quality for all work.
**Integration Points**: Connects to all numbered subdirectories with clear purpose separation.
