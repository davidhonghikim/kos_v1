# Agent Prompt: Documentation System Standards Reconciliation

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: Comprehensive prompt for incoming agents to continue documentation work. Contains critical protections, mission overview, accurate system status, and detailed workflow protocols.

**Implementation Notes**: Includes mandatory exclusions for brainstorm directory (605 files), naming standards reconciliation requirements, and migration workflow for remaining source material.
**Quality Requirements**: Keep system status and file counts accurate. Verify brainstorm directory protection protocols are followed. Maintain technical excellence standards.
**Integration Points**: Links to all major documentation areas and serves as the authoritative onboarding document for new agents working on documentation tasks.

## üö® **CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY BRAINSTORM DIRECTORY**

### **MANDATORY EXCLUSIONS**
- **NEVER modify, move, or reorganize** anything in `documentation/brainstorm/`
- **NEVER apply naming standards** to brainstorm directory
- **NEVER organize or rename** files in brainstorm
- **DO NOT COUNT** brainstorm files in documentation statistics
- **brainstorm/ is SOURCE MATERIAL ONLY** - read but never modify

### **Why This Matters**
The brainstorm directory contains 605+ source specification files that serve as the authoritative source material for migration. Any modification would corrupt the source data and break the migration tracking system.

**When working with documentation:**
- ‚úÖ **READ from** `documentation/brainstorm/` for content
- ‚úÖ **MIGRATE content to** `documentation/06_future/` or other structured directories
- ‚ùå **NEVER modify** files in brainstorm directory
- ‚ùå **NEVER apply** naming conventions to brainstorm

## Mission Overview
You are taking over documentation system work for the Kai-CD project. Your primary mission is to reconcile competing naming standards and continue systematic migration of source material to the structured documentation system.

## üìã ACCURATE SYSTEM STATUS

**SYSTEM STATUS: FUNCTIONAL WITH STANDARDIZATION NEEDS**

### ‚úÖ **Current Reality Verified**:
- **370 documentation files** (excluding brainstorm source material)
- **Well-organized 4-tier structure** (current/future/bridge/reference)
- **High-quality content** with proper frontmatter and Agent Context blocks
- **37% migration complete** (223/605 files migrated from brainstorm/kOS/)
- **Functional cross-reference system** with working navigation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Real Issues Identified**:
- **Standards Conflict**: Two competing naming conventions in use
- **Incomplete Migration**: 382 source files remaining to migrate
- **Placeholder Content**: 12 files need content development
- **Protocol Inconsistency**: Need single authoritative standard

## Your Primary Tasks

### üéØ **PHASE 1: Standards Reconciliation (Priority: High)**

#### **Task 1: Choose Single Naming Standard**
Choose between:
- **Option A**: `##_Title_Case_With_Underscores.md` (current system)
- **Option B**: `descriptive-names-with-hyphens.md` (naming protocol)

**Analysis Required**:
- Review both standards documents
- Assess implementation across directory structure (EXCLUDING brainstorm/)
- Consider impact on existing cross-references
- Choose most practical for long-term maintenance

#### **Task 2: Systematic Standardization**
- Apply chosen standard systematically across documentation (EXCLUDING brainstorm/)
- Update cross-references to match new naming
- Consolidate conflicting standards documents
- Test navigation system integrity

### üéØ **PHASE 2: Content Development (Priority: Medium)**

#### **Task 3: Complete Placeholder Files**
Address these 12 incomplete files:
```
agents/47_Modular_Agent_Loaders.md
agents/53_Agent_Roles_And_Capabilities.md  
agents/54_Agent_Lifecycle_And_Execution.md
agents/56_Ai_Agent_Framework_And_Capabilities.md
services/66_Prompt_Vault_System.md
services/70_User_Profile_System.md
services/72_Service_Orchestration_Hub.md
services/82_Prompt_Storage_Engine.md
security/59_Data_Storage_And_Security.md
deployment/02_Network_Topology_And_Deployment.md
governance/15_Governance_Protocols_And_Interoperability.md
protocols/60_Modular_Agent_Protocols.md
```

#### **Task 4: Continue Source Migration**
- **Source Material**: `documentation/brainstorm/kOS/` (605 files total) - READ ONLY
- **Target Coverage**: Migrate remaining 382 files to structured documentation
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain comprehensive TypeScript examples and technical depth
- **Batch Processing**: Work in manageable batches (50 files recommended)
- **Process**: READ from brainstorm, CREATE new files in appropriate documentation directories

## Critical User Requirements

### **Technical Excellence Standards**:
1. **ALL low-level implementation details must be preserved**
2. **Comprehensive TypeScript examples required in every technical document**
3. **Documentation serves as source of truth for multiple development teams**
4. **NO simplification allowed - maintain full technical complexity**
5. **Agent alignment critical for consistent development approach**

## Documentation System Standards

### **Directory Structure** (Confirmed Working):
```
documentation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_agents/      # Agent workflow documentation (28 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_analysis/    # Analysis and audit documents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_bridge/      # Evolution strategy documents  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_current/     # Kai-CD implementation docs (36 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05_developers/  # Developer guides (48 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 06_future/      # kOS vision docs (223 migrated files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 07_reference/   # Quick reference materials
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 08_users/       # User-facing documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ brainstorm/     # SOURCE MATERIAL (605 files) - DO NOT MODIFY
```

### **Standards Documents to Reconcile**:
1. `00_DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM_MASTER.md` - Mandates numbered format
2. `01_agents/04_quality/naming-protocol.md` - Mandates descriptive format
3. Current implementation shows **both standards actively used**

### **Required Frontmatter Template** (Working):
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Brief description"
type: "architecture|implementation|guide|reference"
status: "current|future|bridge"
priority: "high|medium|low"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
related_docs: ["path/to/related.md"]
implementation_status: "implemented|planned|theoretical"
agent_notes: "AI-specific guidance"
---
```

## Workflow Protocol

### **Two-Edit Rule** (Mandatory):
After making 1-2 significant changes:
1. Read entire files you've modified
2. Trace logic flow and check for errors
3. Verify technical completeness
4. Fix any identified issues
5. Document findings in execution plan

### **Quality Verification**:
After each logical unit of work:
1. Check frontmatter compliance and Agent Context blocks
2. Verify all asset links and references work correctly
3. Ensure TypeScript examples are complete and accurate
4. Confirm cross-references to related documentation
5. Ensure zero content regressions

### **Migration Workflow**:
For systematic migration of remaining source files:
1. **Batch Processing**: Work in batches of 50 files
2. **Quality Gates**: Every document must include complete TypeScript examples
3. **Progress Documentation**: Update execution plan after each batch
4. **Standards Compliance**: Apply chosen naming standard consistently
5. **Continuous Operation**: Continue until all source files are migrated
6. **SOURCE PROTECTION**: Never modify brainstorm/ - only read and migrate content

## Your Deliverables

### **Phase 1: Standards Resolution**
1. **Standards Analysis Report** comparing both naming conventions
2. **Recommendation** for single authoritative standard
3. **Implementation Plan** for systematic standardization (excluding brainstorm/)
4. **Cross-Reference Update Strategy**

### **Phase 2: Content Development**
1. **Placeholder File Completion** (12 files with full content)
2. **Source Material Migration Plan** for remaining 382 files
3. **Quality Assurance Framework** for ongoing work
4. **Progress Tracking System** for systematic migration

## Critical Guidelines

### **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT**:
- ‚ùå **MODIFY ANYTHING in documentation/brainstorm/** - This is source material
- ‚ùå Apply naming conventions to brainstorm directory
- ‚ùå Move or reorganize files in brainstorm
- ‚ùå Count brainstorm files in documentation statistics
- ‚ùå Create emergency procedures for non-emergency issues
- ‚ùå Make false claims about system status
- ‚ùå Simplify or remove technical details
- ‚ùå Skip frontmatter or Agent Context blocks
- ‚ùå Break existing cross-references

### **DO**:
- ‚úÖ **READ from brainstorm/** for content migration
- ‚úÖ **CREATE NEW FILES** in appropriate documentation directories
- ‚úÖ Preserve ALL implementation details
- ‚úÖ Maintain comprehensive TypeScript examples
- ‚úÖ Update execution plan with detailed progress logs
- ‚úÖ Follow established quality standards
- ‚úÖ Continue systematic migration approach

## Starting Point

Begin by reading:
1. `documentation/00_DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM_MASTER.md` - Current master standards
2. `documentation/01_agents/04_quality/naming-protocol.md` - Alternative standard
3. `documentation/01_agents/03_handoffs/current-handoff.md` - Previous work context
4. `documentation/01_agents/02_planning/current-execution-plan.md` - Work log

Then conduct standards analysis and choose single authoritative approach.

**System Status**: Functional and well-organized, requiring standards reconciliation and continued migration work rather than emergency intervention.

## üéØ **MISSION FOCUS**

Your primary mission is **standards reconciliation** followed by **systematic content development**. The documentation system is functional and well-maintained - your job is to resolve the standards conflict and continue the excellent migration work already in progress.

**REMEMBER: brainstorm/ is READ-ONLY source material. Never modify it.**

**The foundation is solid. Build upon it methodically.**
