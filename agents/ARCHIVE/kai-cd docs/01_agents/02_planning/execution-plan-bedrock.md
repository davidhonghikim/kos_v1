# Execution Plan: The "Bedrock" Refactor

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: Comprehensive execution plan for "Bedrock" refactoring methodology covering systematic codebase transformation strategies. Use this when implementing foundational refactoring, understanding bedrock methodology, planning systematic transformations, or executing comprehensive codebase improvements. Essential reference for all foundational refactoring work.

**Implementation Notes**: Contains bedrock refactoring strategies, systematic transformation approaches, foundational improvement methodologies, and comprehensive execution frameworks. Includes detailed refactoring workflows and transformation strategies.
**Quality Requirements**: Keep bedrock refactoring methodology and transformation strategies synchronized with actual implementation progress. Maintain accuracy of foundational improvement approaches and systematic transformation outcomes.
**Integration Points**: Foundation for systematic refactoring, links to implementation planning, code transformation, and architectural improvement for comprehensive bedrock refactoring coverage.

**Status:** In Progress ðŸŸ¡

This document outlines the comprehensive, multi-phase plan to establish a robust and scalable foundation for the Kai-CD project. It directly addresses historical instability, architectural debt, and the need for a single source of truth for all project data and documentation.

## Core Recommendations

This plan is built on three expert-level recommendations to solve the project's core challenges:

1.  **Adopt a Client-Side Database:** The current reliance on `chrome.storage.local` is a critical bottleneck. It will be replaced with a true client-side database using **Dexie.js** (a wrapper for IndexedDB). This provides robust, scalable storage for all application artifacts (services, settings, chats, images, documents, etc.).

2.  **Implement a Unified Artifact Model:** To handle diverse data types in a modular way, a generic `Artifact` model will be created in the database. A `StorageManager` utility using a **Strategy Pattern** will be developed, allowing for different "handlers" for each artifact type (e.g., `ImageHandler`, `DocHandler`), making the system infinitely extensible.

3.  **Secure Sensitive Data:** API keys and other secrets will no longer be stored in plaintext. A `CryptoService` will be built using the browser-native **Web Crypto API** (`SubtleCrypto`) to encrypt and decrypt sensitive fields before they are written to or read from the database.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation - Building the Bedrock

**Goal:** Replace the fragile persistence and state logic with a robust database and fix critical architectural flaws.

1.  **Integrate Dexie.js:**
    *   Add `dexie` as a project dependency.
    *   Create a new directory: `src/db/`.
    *   Define the database schema in `src/db/schema.ts`, outlining the tables (`services`, `artifacts`, `prompts`, `settings`, `logs`).
    *   Create a `DatabaseService.ts` singleton to manage the Dexie instance.

2.  **Migrate Core State to the Database:**
    *   Refactor `serviceStore.ts` and `settingsStore.ts` to use the new `DatabaseService` instead of `chrome.storage.local`.
    *   Implement a one-time, non-destructive migration function to move existing user data into the new database structure.
    *   Integrate the `CryptoService` to encrypt all sensitive fields (e.g., `apiKey`) during migration and for all subsequent database writes.

3.  **Fix Architectural Debt: `ImageGenerationView`:**
    *   Completely refactor `ImageGenerationView.tsx`.
    *   Move all parameter state (e.g., `prompt`, `steps`) from local `useState` hooks into the central `viewStateStore`.
    *   Ensure generated images are saved as `Artifacts` in the database via the `DatabaseService`, making them persistent and accessible application-wide.

## Phase 1: Documentation - The Single Source of Truth

**Goal:** Create the comprehensive, multi-audience documentation suite. This phase will run in parallel with the code review.

1.  **Comprehensive Code Review:**
    *   Systematically review every file in the `src/` directory.
    *   For each file, analyze its logic, dependencies, and runtime behavior.
    *   Document findings, discrepancies with past documentation, and areas needing clarification directly within this plan.
    *   Create detailed Mermaid diagrams to illustrate data flow and component relationships.

2.  **Author Developer Documentation:**
    *   Based on the code review, write a series of detailed markdown files in `documentation/developers/`.
    *   Topics:
        *   `01_Architecture_Overview.md`: High-level system design, diagrams.
        *   `02_Persistence_Layer.md`: Deep dive into the Dexie.js database, schema, and `DatabaseService`.
        *   `03_State_Management.md`: How Zustand and the database interact.
        *   `04_Service_Definitions.md`: The "Rich Service Definition" model.
        *   `05_UI_Components.md`: Breakdown of the React component hierarchy.
        *   `06_Build_System.md`: Explanation of the Vite build process.
        *   `07_Security.md`: Details on the `CryptoService` implementation.

3.  **Author User & Agent Documentation:**
    *   Write user-friendly guides in `documentation/users/`.
    *   Consolidate and update all agent-related rules, workflows, and prompts into `documentation/agents/`.

4.  **Migrate Historical Context:**
    *   Review the `archives/` directory.
    *   Distill critical historical context, bug fixes, and changelogs into a new `documentation/developers/08_Historical_Context.md` document to preserve project knowledge.

## Phase 2: Feature Development - Building on the Bedrock

**Goal:** Build the features you requested, leveraging the new, robust foundation.

1.  **Build the `DocsManager` View:**
    *   Create a new primary view for `viewing, editing, importing, and deleting` documentation.
    *   This view will read/write markdown content from/to the `artifacts` table in the database.
    *   It will feature a rich markdown editor component (e.g., `@uiw/react-md-editor`).

2.  **Build the Centralized `LogViewer`:**
    *   Refactor the `logStore` to persist all application logs to a new `logs` table in the database.
    *   Create a new `LogViewer` view that displays this persisted data, with features for filtering and searching.

3.  **Enhance the Backup Manager:**
    *   Update `src/utils/backupManager.ts` to use the `DatabaseService`.
    *   The `exportData` function will now pull all data from the database into a single, versioned JSON file.
