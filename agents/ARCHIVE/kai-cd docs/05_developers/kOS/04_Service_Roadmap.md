## Documentation Template Structure

Each service documentation should follow this comprehensive structure:

```markdown
# [Service Name] - kOS Integration Guide

## Service Overview
- **Purpose**: What this service does
- **Category**: AI Model / Vector DB / Storage / Workflow / etc.
- **Provider**: Company/Organization
- **License**: Open source / Commercial / etc.

## Current Implementation Status
- **Integration Level**: Basic / Advanced / Expert
- **Completion**: X% complete
- **Key Features**: List of implemented features
- **Known Limitations**: Current gaps or issues

## kOS Integration Analysis

### Protocol Compatibility
- **KLP Support**: Native / Adapter / Planned

- **A2A Integration**: Supported / Planned
- **ANP Federation**: Supported / Planned

### Identity & Authentication
- **Current Auth**: API keys / OAuth / etc.
- **DID Integration**: Planned implementation
- **Trust Model**: How service fits in kOS trust network

### Capability Discovery
```json
{
  "serviceId": "service-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": ["capability1", "capability2"],
  "roles": ["role1", "role2"],
  "protocols": ["klp/1.0", "mcp/1.0"],
  "endpoints": {
    "primary": "klp://service.example.com",
    "fallback": "https://api.example.com"
  }
}
```

### Federation Model
- **Sharing Pattern**: Private / Federated / Public
- **Resource Requirements**: CPU / GPU / Memory / Storage
- **Scaling Characteristics**: How it scales in mesh network

## Technical Architecture

### Connection Patterns
- **Direct**: Service runs locally
- **Proxy**: Service behind gateway
- **Federated**: Service shared across nodes
- **Hybrid**: Multiple connection modes

### Message Flow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[kAI Client] --> B[KLP Router]
    B --> C[Service Adapter]
    C --> D[Service Instance]
    D --> E[External API/Local Process]
```

### State Management
- **Local State**: What's kept locally
- **Shared State**: What's federated
- **Persistence**: How data is stored
- **Synchronization**: How state syncs across nodes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: KLP Wrapper (Week X)
- [ ] Basic KLP message handling
- [ ] Service capability registration
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Basic authentication

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week X+1)
- [ ] DID-based authentication
- [ ] Capability negotiation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics

### Phase 3: Federation Support (Week X+2)
- [ ] Cross-node service sharing
- [ ] Trust and reputation integration
- [ ] Load balancing and failover
- [ ] Governance participation

## Code Examples

### KLP Service Adapter
```typescript
import { KLPService, ServiceCapability } from '@kai/klp';

export class [ServiceName]KLPAdapter extends KLPService {
  async initialize() {
    // Service initialization
  }
  
  async handleRequest(message: KLPMessage) {
    // Request handling
  }
  
  getCapabilities(): ServiceCapability[] {
    // Return service capabilities
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Delegation
```typescript
// Example of how other agents can use this service
const result = await agentManager.delegateTask({
  serviceType: 'service-name',
  capability: 'specific-capability',
  parameters: { /* task parameters */ }
});
```

## Testing & Validation

### Integration Tests
- [ ] KLP message handling
- [ ] Service capability discovery
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Error scenarios

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Latency**: Target < Xms for typical requests
- **Throughput**: Target X requests/second
- **Resource Usage**: CPU/Memory/Network limits

### Security Validation
- [ ] DID authentication working
- [ ] Message encryption/signing
- [ ] Access control enforcement
- [ ] Audit logging

## Migration Path

### From Current Implementation
1. **Wrapper Phase**: Add KLP adapter around existing connector
2. **Enhancement Phase**: Add kOS-specific features
3. **Federation Phase**: Enable cross-node sharing
4. **Optimization Phase**: Performance and reliability improvements

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing configurations should continue working
- Gradual migration of authentication methods
- Fallback to direct API calls if KLP unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Connection Problems**: How to diagnose and fix
- **Authentication Failures**: DID vs. legacy auth issues
- **Performance Issues**: Optimization strategies
- **Federation Problems**: Cross-node communication issues

### Debugging Tools
- KLP message inspector
- Service capability validator
- Performance profiler
- Network topology viewer

## Future Roadmap

### Short Term (1-3 months)
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Additional capability discovery

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
- Advanced federation features
- Cross-service orchestration
- Enhanced security features

### Long Term (6+ months)
