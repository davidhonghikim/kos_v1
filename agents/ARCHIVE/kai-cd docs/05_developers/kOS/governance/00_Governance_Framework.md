# 01: kOS Governance Framework

> **Source**: `documentation/brainstorm/kOS/100_k_os_governance.md`  
> **Migrated**: 2025-01-20  
> **Status**: Core System Document

## Overview

This document outlines the governance, moderation, and trust-building protocols across the decentralized Kind Operating System (kOS). It defines role hierarchies, trust scoring, community consensus mechanisms, and conflict resolution systems for the kOS ecosystem.

## Governance Architecture

### Hybrid Decentralized Governance (HDG)

The kOS governance model combines three complementary approaches:

- **Local Autonomy**: Each kOS node/operator maintains authority over its own space
- **Federated Trust Layer**: Shared standards and APIs for consensus and moderation
- **Global Consensus Mechanism**: Optional network-wide proposals, votes, and updates

### Governance Layers

| Layer | Scope | Authority |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Node Level** | Individual installations | Configurable, autonomous policies per operator |
| **Community Layer** | Groups of nodes | Federations define shared norms and standards |
| **Network Level** | Global protocol | Root protocol decisions, software upgrades, threat responses |

## Roles and Hierarchies

### Core Roles

| Role | Permissions | Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **user** | Participate, publish, vote (based on trust level) | Standard ecosystem participation |
| **moderator** | Flag/report/remove local content, apply temp restrictions | Content and behavior moderation |
| **custodian** | Configure node-level policy, assign roles, manage agent behavior | Node administration and management |
| **arbiter** | Mediate cross-node disputes, hold rotating keys for consensus validation | Dispute resolution and consensus facilitation |
| **core-dev** | Propose and sign protocol updates | Protocol development and maintenance |
| **founder** | Legacy early-member tier, historical privileges in certain federations | Historical governance participation |

### Role Management

#### Role Inheritance & Delegation
- **Hierarchical Permissions**: Roles inherit permissions from lower tiers (e.g., `custodian` > `moderator`)
- **Delegation System**: Signed role grants via Kind Link Protocol (KLP)
- **Credential Management**: Expiring or revocable credentials with cryptographic verification

#### Role Assignment Process
1. **Nomination**: Community or self-nomination for roles
2. **Verification**: Identity and capability verification
3. **Approval**: Community consensus or custodian approval
4. **Activation**: Role credentials issued via KLP

## Trust System

### Trust Score (TS)

**Range**: 0.0 – 1.0 (decimal precision)

**Calculation Factors**:
- **Uptime/Participation**: Regular ecosystem engagement
- **Moderation History**: Reports filed vs. received ratio
- **Community Endorsements**: Trusted member recommendations
- **Behavior Analysis**: Rate limiting compliance, toxicity scores, helpfulness metrics

### Reputation Framework

#### Reputation Anchors
- **Public Achievement Log**: Notable events (elections, dispute resolutions, contributions)
- **Distributed Storage**: Cryptographically secured reputation records
- **Immutable History**: Tamper-proof reputation tracking

#### Cross-Network Verification
- **Remote Validation**: Nodes validate Trust Scores using Kind Identity (KID) signatures
- **Chain of Trust**: Local node → federation → network root certificate
- **Reputation Portability**: Trust scores transferable across compatible federations

## Proposals & Voting System

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Authored locally or via federation DAO
2. **Published**: Timestamped and visible to eligible voters
3. **Active Vote**: Specific time window for community voting
4. **Finalized**: Proposal adopted or rejected with recorded outcome

### Voting Methods

| Method | Use Case | Benefits |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Quadratic Voting** | Default method | Prevents wealth concentration, encourages broad participation |
| **Simple Majority** | Basic decisions | Clear, straightforward outcomes |
| **Delegated Stake** | Complex issues | Leverages expertise through delegation |
| **Ranked Choice** | Multiple options | Nuanced preference expression |

### Proposal Types

| Type | Scope | Binding Status | Examples |
|------|-------|----------------|----------|
| **local-policy** | Node or federation level | Yes | Content policies, user guidelines |
| **agent-behavior** | Core agent modifications | Yes | Agent capability changes, security updates |
| **protocol-upgrade** | Global software changes | Yes | Core protocol modifications, API changes |
| **social-contract** | Community values/policies | Optional | Community standards, ethical guidelines |

## Dispute Resolution & Conflict Systems

### Local Disputes

**Participants**: `moderator` + `custodian` roles
**Process**:
1. **Issue Flagging**: Community or automated flagging
2. **Evidence Review**: Timestamped logs and documentation
3. **Resolution Options**: Warning, timeout, shadowban, escalation

### Federation Conflicts

**Arbitration**: Elected `arbiter` quorum system
**Evidence Standards**:
- Cryptographically verified logs
- KID-verified statements and testimony
- Documented evidence (screenshots, communications)

**Resolution Process**:
1. **Conflict Filing**: Formal dispute submission
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Structured evidence collection
3. **Arbitration**: Neutral arbiter review and decision
4. **Public Report**: Signed resolution with timeline

### Network-Level Conflicts

**Triggers**: Security threats, protocol violations, rogue node behavior
**Emergency Protocols**:
- **Emergency Vote Window**: 6–24 hours based on severity rating
- **Root Proposal System**: Network-wide emergency measures
- **Quarantine Protocols**: TrustLinkGraph invalidation for threat mitigation

## Auditing and Transparency

### Action Logging

**Comprehensive Audit Trail**:
- **Actor Identification**: Kind Identity (KID) of action performer
- **Timestamp**: Precise action timing
- **Action Summary**: Detailed description of governance action
- **Object Reference**: Affected message, user, or proposal ID

**Cryptographic Integrity**:
- **Merkle Tree Storage**: Tamper-proof log chain
- **Distributed Verification**: Multi-node log validation
- **Immutable Records**: Permanent governance action history

### Transparency Infrastructure

#### Transparency Portals
Optional federation and node-hosted portals displaying:
- **Vote Outcomes**: Historical voting results and participation
- **Agent Audit Logs**: Automated agent action records
- **Role Assignments**: Current governance role holders
- **Open Proposals**: Active community proposals and discussions

#### Public Accountability
- **Regular Reporting**: Periodic governance activity summaries
- **Community Access**: Public access to non-sensitive governance data
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Community input on governance effectiveness

## Federation Templates

### Predefined Governance Modules

| Template | Features | Ideal Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **civic-demo** | Majority voting, transparent logs, minimal moderation | Small communities, experimental governance |
| **council-vote** | Role-weighted quorum model, structured decision-making | Academic institutions, enterprise environments |
| **default-open** | Moderation-enabled, trust score access control | Public nodes, testnets, general communities |

### Template Customization
- **Modular Configuration**: Mix and match governance features
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust voting thresholds, time windows, role requirements
- **Custom Extensions**: Community-specific governance additions

## Security Considerations

### Governance Security Framework

#### Role Abuse Prevention
- **Revocation Mechanisms**: Immediate role credential revocation
- **Audit Alerts**: Automated suspicious activity detection
- **Community Oversight**: Peer review of governance actions

#### Attack Mitigation
- **Sybil Attack Prevention**: Decentralized identity weighting and verification
- **Federation Splits**: 2/3 quorum requirement for configuration forks
- **Upgrade Security**: Multisig validation from `core-dev` role holders

#### Threat Response
- **Rapid Response Protocols**: Emergency governance activation
- **Network Isolation**: Quarantine capabilities for compromised nodes
- **Recovery Procedures**: Post-incident governance restoration
