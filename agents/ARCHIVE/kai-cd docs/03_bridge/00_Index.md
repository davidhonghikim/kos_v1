# Bridge Directory Index

This directory contains strategic documents for transitioning from the current Kai-CD architecture to the future kOS ecosystem.

## Documents

### Strategic Framework
- **[Decision_Framework.md](Decision_Framework.md)** - Five-factor analysis framework for architectural decisions
- **[Service_Migration.md](Service_Migration.md)** - Comprehensive migration strategy from Kai-CD to kOS

## Purpose

The bridge documents serve as the strategic link between:
- **Current State**: Kai-CD browser extension architecture
- **Future Vision**: kOS distributed agent ecosystem
- **Evolution Path**: Systematic migration and enhancement strategy

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: These documents provide decision-making frameworks and migration strategies. Use them when making architectural decisions that affect both current functionality and future kOS compatibility.
