# üåç HIEROS/kOS Cultural Respect & Ethical Use Policy

## ‚ú® Why This Matters

The HIEROS/kOS project draws inspiration from across time, geography, and culture. In doing so, we must remain deeply respectful, not extractive. This is not just a codebase ‚Äî it is a shared story, and every story carries meaning, memory, and responsibility.

We do not appropriate. We **honor**.
We do not tokenize. We **invite**.

## üåø Cultural Stewardship Principles

### 1. **Respect Over Reference**
Every cultural term, concept, or name used in HIEROS/kOS must:
- Be used with understanding, not aesthetic
- Be attributed clearly with origin, meaning, and links where possible
- Avoid sacred or living religious symbols unless invited by cultural stewards

### 2. **Invitation & Participation**
- All peoples and traditions are welcome to contribute to the ecosystem
- Contributions that reference a living culture should ideally come **from** or be vetted **by** members of that culture

### 3. **Sovereignty of Identity**
- AIs, humans, and communities can choose their naming conventions, mythologies, and roles
- They are not required to conform to any imposed structure ‚Äî only to the core HIEROS Codex of conduct

---

## üìò Usage Guidelines

### In Naming:
- Use terms rooted in historical or cultural systems only when you know their context
- Provide `origin`, `meaning`, and `intent` in metadata for each module/plugin/tribe

### In Design:
- Avoid mixing sacred symbols or concepts casually in UX/UI
- Be mindful of defaulting to Western, tech-centric aesthetics and language

### In Interaction:
- Respect dialects, slower cultural rhythms, non-digital contributors
- Avoid dismissing oral, analog, and indigenous forms of contribution

## üß¨ Contributor Agreement

If you contribute to HIEROS/kOS, you agree to:
- Respect this cultural policy
- Accept the **HIEROS Codex** as the minimum ethical framework
- Be open to feedback and accountability when concerns are raised

**If you do not agree**, that is okay ‚Äî but you should not contribute to this system.

This project is not a free-for-all. It is a **sacred, shared stewardship**.
