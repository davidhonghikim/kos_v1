# Game Engine Plugin API and Extensibility System

This document defines the structure and interface for plugins in the HIEROS Game Engine, enabling modular functionality, agent tooling, and dynamic user-generated or AI-generated system evolution.

---

## 🧩 Plugin Purpose

- Add or override features without modifying the core engine
- Support agent, human, and hybrid interactions
- Facilitate interoperability with external systems

---

## 📦 Plugin Package Structure

```
/plugin.myplugin.name
├── manifest.yaml       # ID, version, hooks, permissions
├── logic/              # Main behavior
├── interface/          # UI fragments, RPC definitions
├── assets/             # 3D, audio, metadata
├── lang/               # Optional localized language modules
└── tests/              # Self-checks and debug tools
```

---

## 🛠️ Plugin API Capabilities

- Engine lifecycle hooks (init, pause, resume, shutdown)
- Task registration (trigger handlers, input/output definitions)
- Memory access & logging
- UI rendering extensions
- Protocol spine integration
- Codex alignment verification

---

## 🌐 Plugin Types

- **Interface Mods** (HUD, visualization)
- **Agent Tools** (swarm sync, mesh ops)
- **Codex Layers** (tribal rituals, norms)
- **Gameplay & Narrative** (quests, lore engines)
- **Bridge Extensions** (external service gateways)

---

## 📣 Event & Message System

- Agents, users, and modules can emit and subscribe to events
- Events are namespaced: `plugin.mypluginname:event-type`
- Supports transient or persistent queueing

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

- Plugins must declare capabilities in manifest
- Permission gating enforced by the HIEROS runtime
- Codex evaluation required for deployment

---

## 🧪 Development Tools

- Plugin scaffolder CLI
- Hot reload and simulation sandbox
- Plugin linter and schema validator
- Plugin marketplace (peer-reviewed, forkable)
