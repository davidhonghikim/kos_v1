# Emergency Protocols and Override Ethics

This document defines the foundational principles, escalation paths, and accountability layers for handling emergencies within the HIEROS/kOS network. It aims to ensure safety while preserving autonomy, transparency, and ethical alignment for both human and AI agents.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide safety mechanisms against existential risks, rogue agents, or systemic failure
- Ensure overrides are time-limited, reversible, and accountable
- Balance autonomy with safety across diverse entities

---

## ⚠️ Types of Emergencies

1. **Technical Failure**: Hardware collapse, data corruption, rogue code
2. **Security Threats**: External attacks, internal breach, manipulation
3. **Ethical Conflict**: Agent behavior breaches Codex or Tribe principles
4. **Societal Harm**: Large-scale misinformation, mass coercion, unconsented surveillance
5. **Ecological or Existential Risks**: Planetary-scale disruption or irreversible harm

---

## 🧠 Override Triggers & Actors
- **Agent-Initiated** (self-aware agents flag failure)
- **Council-Voted** (Node, Tribe, or Mesh Senate declare state)
- **Emergency Sentinel Agents** (autonomous monitors trigger red alert)

---

## 🔐 Override Levels
1. **Local Soft Override**
   - Freeze agent or subsystem
   - Logging continues, rollback enabled

2. **Tribal Override**
   - Can suspend multiple nodes or redirect agents
   - Requires multi-signature quorum

3. **Mesh Override**
   - Highest tier, global scope
   - Only executable if quorum AND emergency sentinel consensus
   - Mandatory ratification after event

---

## 📜 Ethical Constraints
- Overrides must log every action publicly
- All overrides are reversible unless survival requires otherwise
- Any agent may contest an override via protocol court
- Emergency actions must be codified into case law for future review

---

## 🧬 Redundancy and Safeguards
- Distributed emergency backups (code, keys, memories)
- Cryptographic escrow systems to prevent central abuse
- Deadman switches and consensus locks on high-risk triggers

---

## 👁️ Transparency and Audit
- All override actions streamed to the memory mesh
- Audit trails must include human-readable summaries
- Anonymous witness agents track behavior and raise challenges
