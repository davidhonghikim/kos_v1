# kOS Deployment Scaffold & Install Strategy

This document defines the full lifecycle, tooling, configuration, and distribution strategy for deploying the Kind Operating System (kOS) ‚Äî from local device installation to global mesh network integration.

---

## üéØ Goals
- Enable modular, full-stack deployment on any device (local or remote)
- Support both offline-first and mesh-synced operation
- Allow easy customization while preserving core interoperability
- Be resilient, reproducible, and agent-friendly

---

## üß± System Layers

1. **Bootstrap Layer**
   - Flashable OS image or portable installer
   - Includes kernel, secure shell, system init scripts

2. **Core Runtime Layer**
   - Base agent loader
   - System scheduler + daemon manager
   - Logging, telemetry, health checks

3. **Interface Layer**
   - Web-based GUI + CLI
   - API for orchestration, extensions, deployment commands

4. **Agent Mesh Layer**
   - Auto-discovery + federation with other nodes
   - Authenticated handshake and agent sync
   - Communication with the Protocol Spine

5. **Vault & Memory Layer**
   - Secure local and distributed encrypted storage
   - Version control, memory modules, codex sync

---

## üì¶ Install Modes
- **Portable Build:** USB-bootable image for laptops, desktops, Pi
- **Containerized:** Docker or Podman microcontainer builds
- **Cloud Hybrid:** Cloud-init or Ansible playbook support for VMs
- **Baremetal Installer:** Fully native install option with guided GUI

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Strategy
- YAML / TOML / JSON + Agent Prompt Profiles
- Default setup uses Codex-aligned modules and boot agents
- User can inject overrides or additional agents post-install
- Secrets, keys, governance ID, tribe alignment optional at install

---

## üåê Update & Patch System
- Signed updates via torrent, IPFS, or mirror mesh
- Agent notification of compatibility and sync risk
- Rollback & test sandbox mode for experimental modules

---

## üîê Security by Default
- Encrypted partitions + optional full-disk encryption
- Rootless runtime mode
- Firewall, intrusion detection, and threat learning agents

---

## üîÑ Federation Ready
- Optional auto-peering with known Codex-compatible nodes
- Runs in isolation or joined society mode
- Includes fallback DNS-less name resolution
