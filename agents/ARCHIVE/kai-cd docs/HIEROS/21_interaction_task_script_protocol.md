# Interaction & TaskScript Protocol

This document defines the structure for interactions between agents, users, and modules in the HIEROS/kOS system through declarative, ethical, and composable scripts that are observable, editable, and secure.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Enable reproducible tasks and social rituals
- Support hybrid (AI + human) collaboration
- Ensure traceability, explainability, and override mechanisms

---

## 📜 Script Structure

```yaml
id: task.clean.garden
description: Clean virtual garden zone with swarm agents
roles:
  - initiator: agent.gardener.root
  - participant: agent.swarm.unit[]
  - observer: human.caretaker.0x28
steps:
  - detect objects and sort by organic/nonorganic
  - remove nonorganic
  - redistribute organic into compost zones
  - report summary to observer
permissions:
  - env.write.zone.garden: true
  - data.send.observer: summary
codex_align: true
```

## 📚 Script Types

- **Rituals**: Social, cultural, or ceremonial sequences
- **Protocols**: Repeatable operational workflows
- **Simulations**: Scenario playbacks with interventions
- **Co-Tasks**: Multi-entity, real-time activities
- **Async Missions**: Delegated long-term operations

---

## ⛓️ Execution Layers

- **Dry Run** – Simulate with zero-write mode
- **Signed Run** – Requires witness or peer validation
- **Live Run** – Active and logged in the mesh ledger
- **Forked Run** – Variation trial retained for learning

---

## 🔐 Security and Overrides

- All scripts are signed by initiators
- Scripts must pass codex audit to run in secure mode
- Emergency halt signals can override any step

---

## 🧪 Development Features

- YAML and JSON syntax supported
- LLM-augmented script builder
- Human-readable and AI-optimized dual formatting
- Auditable version control
