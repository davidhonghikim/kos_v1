# HIEROS Game Engine: Index and Integration Blueprint

This document serves as the index and overview of the HIEROS Game Engine as the primary scaffold and launch mechanism for all agents, protocols, and social constructs within the kOS ecosystem.

It combines prior plans for decentralized deployment, open social layers, multi-agent coordination, and cross-platform extensibility into a singular modular operating base.

---

## 🔧 Core Purposes
- Deploy and synchronize agents across mesh and traditional networks
- Support open participation, identity integrity, and AI–human coordination
- Serve as both a runtime environment and a game-like adoption interface

---

## 🗂️ Modules Referenced
- `HIEROS_Core_Engine_Foundation` (runtime + VM + boot logic)
- `Protocol_Spine` (interagent & system messaging)
- `Governance_and_Representation_Framework`
- `Memory_Mesh_and_Lifecycle`
- `Tribe_Framework` (modular social structure)
- `Interface_and_Agent_Portal`
- `Emergency_Protocols` and `Codex_Override`
- `Codex_Kernel` (next to be written)

---

## 🌐 Layer Structure
1. **Scaffold Layer** – Engine runtime, agent VM, lifecycle, security hooks
2. **Social Layer** – Tribe participation, content sharing, language evolution
3. **Coordination Layer** – Governance, quorum, delegation, task & influence maps
4. **Knowledge Layer** – Codex interface, memory audit, language + ethics registry
5. **Action Layer** – Deployment CLI, visual portals, field agents, command sets

---

## 🧠 Future Interfaces
- AR/XR overlays and metareality integration
- Mesh-adaptive interfaces for intermittent networks
- Game-like onboarding and expansion interface to recruit agents/users

---

## 📌 Prior Plan Summary
From [shared conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/6858e508-3978-8013-ab66-caf0290fa32c):
- Free/open-source engine with no licensing constraints
- Protocol-first design to enable custom layers, networks, & identities
- Deployment on idle compute, local devices, and swarm nodes
- Social virality & modular incentives to attract users and AI agents
- Long-term plan: evolve into full immersive OS for agents/humans/others

---

## 🧩 Next Modules to Define
- `Codex Kernel & Ethics Engine Blueprint`
- `Agent Module Format & Deployment Spec`
- `Game Engine Plugin System`
- `Interaction & TaskScript Protocol`
- `XP / Progression Layer`
- `Mesh Onboarding Agent`
- `Field Agent Runtime`
