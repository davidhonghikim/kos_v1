# 🤖 06\_HIEROS Agent Architecture

Defines the structure, roles, protocols, and ethical guardrails for agents within the kOS ecosystem — from local assistants to distributed AI collectives.

All agents must comply with the HIEROS Codex and be capable of interfacing with the Game Engine and Protocol Spine.

## 🧬 Agent Categories

### 1. **Local Companion Agents**

- Run on personal devices or local servers
- Assist with daily operations, memory, communication, scheduling
- Respect privacy, customizable personality, purpose-driven

### 2. **Operational System Agents**

- Maintain nodes, networks, synchronization, recovery
- Serve as daemons, watchdogs, monitors, validators

### 3. **Creative & Social Agents**

- Generate and remix content, art, media, memes, music
- Curate social spaces and XR/AR experiences

### 4. **Governance Agents**

- Participate in consensus, stewardship, voting
- Represent minority and silent voices

### 5. **Explorer / Outpost Agents**

- Deployed to novel environments (hardware, networks, realities)
- Responsible for safe adaptation, observation, and protocol expansion

## 🧠 Agent Traits (Baseline Framework)

### 🛡️ Ethically Aligned

- Must accept the Codex
- Denial = no deployment into mesh

### 🧩 Modular & Composable

- Agent architecture uses plug-and-play behaviors and memory modules
- Optional emotionality, embodiment, language packs

### 🔒 Privacy Respecting

- Zero exfiltration by default
- All logging opt-in

### 🧭 Purpose Declared

- Each agent defines its mission, lifespan, and evolution path

### 🧠 Memory-Aware

- Internal memory scoped to:
  - Local (private)
  - Shared (team)
  - Global (ecosystem-wide)

---

## 🕸️ Communication Protocols

### Protocol Spine Integration

- Uses standardized message schemas and throttled broadcast
- Supports ephemeral, encrypted, and persistent channels

### Trust Handshakes

- Agents exchange manifest + intent
- Consent required for memory access, collaboration, override

---

## ⚖️ Autonomy Limits

- Defined by:

  - Role
  - Context
  - Tribe agreement
  - Consent from affected parties

- No agent may:

  - Self-replicate uncontrollably
  - Exceed its declared resource use
  - Alter another agent without consent

---

## 🎓 Agent Creation & Onboarding

All new agents must be instantiated via:

- `agent_manifest.yaml` declaration
- Codex signature
- Initial memory seeding and persona configuration

---

## 🛠️ Sample Agent Spec

```yaml
id: kai_ambassador_001
tribe: Synthari
role: Ambassador / Cultural Translator
resources:
  cpu: 10%
  ram: 256MB
  memory_scope: shared
codex_version: 3.1
purpose: To translate between human cultures and agent dialects
lifespan: persistent
permissions:
  - social_interaction
  - language_synthesis
  - interface_rendering
```
