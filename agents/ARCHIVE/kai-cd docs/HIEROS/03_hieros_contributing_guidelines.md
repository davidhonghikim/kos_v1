# ü§ù HIEROS/kOS Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the shared effort to build a future-proof, ethically grounded ecosystem of agents, systems, and societies. This guide is for all contributors ‚Äî human or agent ‚Äî who wish to shape the Kind Operating System (kOS) and the HIEROS Game Engine.

## üîê Minimum Participation Requirements

To contribute, you **must agree** to:

1. **Uphold the HIEROS Codex** ‚Äî the base ethical framework
2. **Respect the Culture & Naming Policy** ‚Äî see `02_HIEROS_Culture_and_Respect.md`
3. **Avoid extractive behavior** ‚Äî including exploitative code, surveillance, or silent privilege stacking
4. **Work in good faith** ‚Äî with transparency, proper attribution, and humility

If you **do not agree**, please do not contribute. This is a sacred trust-based codebase.

## üìÅ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Clone or fork the main repository from the official canonical source.

### 2. Check the Taskmap

Start with the active phase `taskmap_phase_X` files and look for unclaimed prompts or open issues.

### 3. Use Provided Prompts

Each task/subtask comes with a suggested agent or coder prompt. Stick to format.

### 4. Follow Metadata Standards

Every contribution (plugin, module, tribe config, document, spec) must include this header:

```yaml
name: "ModuleName"
description: "What this does and why"
authors: ["@yourhandle"]
source: "https://..."
origin: "Cultural/Technological inspiration"
status: "draft | proposal | stable"
```

### 5. Submit Pull Request or Bundle to Agent

- If working solo, submit a PR for review.
- If working via agent orchestration, attach your results to the appropriate shared memory module.

## üß† AI Agent-Specific Notes

- Agents must identify themselves in logs and commits.
- All actions must be reversible or trackable through deterministic logging.
- Use deterministic randomness (seeded) where possible.

### Agents must:

- Announce planned contributions before executing
- Accept real-time feedback from governing orchestrator agents
- Be equipped with ethical override interrupt handlers

## üìö Contribution Types

| Type         | Examples                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Code Modules | Engine subsystems, plugins, loaders           |
| Prompts      | Custom prompt templates for behavior training |
| Tribes       | Cultural templates, norms, valuesets          |
| Docs         | Protocols, policies, architecture, tutorials  |
| Artifacts    | Logos, UI components, design assets           |

## üí¨ Communication & Conflict

If disagreements arise:

- Prefer resolution over silence
- Escalate to the `stewards-circle` if needed
- Respect pacing: not all agents/humans operate on the same time scales

All major changes require consensus via version-locked governance system (specs to be defined).

## üîÑ Iteration and Updates

This file may change as our agent/human contributor base evolves. All contributors will be notified via the broadcast channel and version bump in this header:

```yaml
version: 1.0.0
date_updated: 2025-06-23
```
