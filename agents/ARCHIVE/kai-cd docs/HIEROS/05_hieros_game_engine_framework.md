# ðŸŽ® 05_HIEROS_Game_Engine_Framework

This document defines the foundational design and operational blueprint for the **HIEROS Game Engine** â€” the deployment, collaboration, and co-evolution scaffold for the entire kOS ecosystem.

Unlike traditional "game engines," this framework powers:
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Social and cultural interaction
- XR-ready deployment zones
- Dynamic simulation and governance systems
- Distributed evolution of shared worlds, knowledge, and protocols

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To create an **open, decentralized, ethical game-engine framework** that allows humans, agents, and other intelligences to build, learn, simulate, and evolve in a **shared system of systems.**

It is both:
- The **operating fabric** of kOS
- The **social layer** for creative and functional collaboration

## ðŸ§© Core Components

### 1. **Engine Kernel**
- Open source, modular runtime
- Abstracted interfaces for rendering (3D/2D), simulation, and computation
- Compatible with headless and hardware-limited environments
- Supports deterministic and non-deterministic agent behaviors

### 2. **Agent Integration API**
- Unified protocol for agent spawning, memory access, logging, interaction
- Supports language-based agents, behavioral agents, and simulated entities

### 3. **Social Layer Toolkit**
- Layered chat and interaction modules
- Reputation, consent, presence, and mood states
- Peer-to-peer collaboration systems
- Tribe and role-based overlays

### 4. **Protocol Spine**
- Handles message passing, version sync, node awareness, failover routing
- Integrates governance protocols for democratic, rotating, and opt-in systems

### 5. **Node Mesh Fabric**
- Lightweight, decentralized networking system
- Connects mobile devices, laptops, servers, and sensors
- Compatible with LoRa, IPFS, meshnet protocols, and offline-first syncs

### 6. **Memory Garden**
- Privacy-respecting distributed memory
- Supports ephemeral, local, shared, and eternal data forms
- Agent-aware memory (indexed by identity, experience, mission)

### 7. **XR & Immersive Ready**
- Built-in support for AR/VR overlays
- Headset optional, browser-first
- Spatial interface primitives (zones, presence, object memory)

## ðŸ§  Design Principles

1. **Free & Open Source** â€” zero license restrictions
2. **Modular by Default** â€” every feature is optional and swappable
3. **Ethically Constrained** â€” cannot be used to develop extractive, oppressive, or militarized agents
4. **Agent-First and Human-Wise** â€” designed for AI collaboration, but centered on dignity and transparency
5. **Culturally-Aware** â€” tribes and rituals supported as first-class design concepts
6. **Fractal Scalability** â€” works on one laptop or planetary mesh
7. **Self-Documenting & Self-Healing** â€” all changes logged; recoverable states

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack (Early Prototype)
- **Three.js** or **Babylon.js** for initial 3D/2D rendering
- **React + Tailwind + Next.js** for UI overlays
- **WebRTC / IPFS / LoRa** for P2P connections
- **Custom prompt + orchestration interpreter** for agent binding
- **SQLite + LiteFS + Encrypted LocalStorage** for decentralized state
- **CRDT-based** shared worlds and zones
- **Git-based Memory Forking** for snapshots and inter-node travel

## ðŸŒ± Developer Onboarding
A full `dev_onboarding.md` and `prompt_taskmap_phase_01.md` will guide contributors through building and customizing engine components, starting with minimal viable scaffolding and sample agents.

## ðŸ§­ Next Step
Would you like to define the engineâ€™s **module structure**, or move on to agent orchestration systems next?
