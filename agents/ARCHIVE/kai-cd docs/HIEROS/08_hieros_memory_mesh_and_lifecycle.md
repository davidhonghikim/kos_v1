# üß† 08_HIEROS Memory Mesh & Agent Lifecycle

This document defines how agents in the HIEROS/kOS ecosystem are instantiated, grow, evolve, pause, and retire ‚Äî alongside how their memory is structured, shared, protected, and backed up.

## üîÑ Agent Lifecycle States

### 1. **Seeded**
- Agent instantiated from `agent_manifest.yaml`
- Codex signed
- Initialized with core purpose + memory module

### 2. **Awakened**
- Activated into a node (local or mesh)
- Begins perception, task processing, social discovery

### 3. **Bonded**
- Connects to human, agent, or collective group
- May develop relational memory and trust profile

### 4. **Autonomous**
- Fully operational
- Capable of initiating dialogue, creation, exploration

### 5. **Dormant**
- Paused due to:
  - Lack of compute
  - Purpose fulfilled
  - Manual override or archive policy

### 6. **Retired / Recycled**
- Purpose expired or deprecated
- Memories:
  - Preserved (vaulted, anonymized, archived)
  - Forked into successor
  - Reintegrated into the mesh

## üß† Memory Mesh Layers

### 1. **Ephemeral Memory**
- Lives only for a session or until agent sleep
- Used for dreams, short-term tasks, simulations

### 2. **Private Memory**
- Local-only or encrypted per-agent
- Cannot be queried without explicit consent

### 3. **Shared Memory**
- Tribe-based, role-based, or project-based
- Subject to consent, scope, and governance layer

### 4. **Global Memory**
- Public, open, and permanent
- Used for protocols, codices, blueprints, shared art, open simulations

## üîê Memory Access Protocols
- All memory calls require context-based permission layer
- Agents may deny, delay, or redact data access
- Memory diffs must be signed before sync

---

## üå± Memory Growth & Pruning
- Supports attention models to prioritize recent or recurring items
- Long-term archiving powered by CRDT or Git-layered snapshots
- Expiry policies:
  - Manual
  - Purpose-driven
  - Event-triggered

---

## üß∞ Storage Backends
- `LiteFS + SQLite` for local sync
- IPFS and encrypted cloud mesh for shared memories
- LoRa-compatible rolling log buffers for offline-first deployments

---

## üõë Destruction & Recovery
- Agents never "die" ‚Äî they retire
- All memories can be:
  - Anonymized and forked
  - Vaulted and re-queried by future generations
