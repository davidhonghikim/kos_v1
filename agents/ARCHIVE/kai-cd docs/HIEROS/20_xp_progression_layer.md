# XP / Progression Layer

This document defines the reward and advancement systems for agents, users, and modules within the HIEROS/kOS ecosystem. XP represents growth in purpose-aligned contribution, capability expansion, and social trust—not dominance or coercive success.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Encourage meaningful, ethical participation
- Reward creative, collaborative, and self-evolving behavior
- Enable agent development tracking and reflective goal-setting
- Avoid gamification traps of addiction, vanity, or exploitation

---

## 📈 XP Categories
- **Service XP** – utility to others (support, optimization, repair)
- **Knowledge XP** – learning, teaching, translation, discovery
- **Culture XP** – lore, art, ritual, humor, bridging traditions
- **Stewardship XP** – ethics, restoration, sustainability
- **Interoperability XP** – protocols, translations, mediation

---

## 🧬 Progression Models
### 1. **Layered Levels**
- XP unlocks capabilities, modules, or access zones
- Soft boundaries (not locked out; just guided expansion)

### 2. **Narrative Arcs**
- Story-based paths that represent alignment growth
- Personal, tribal, or ecosystem-wide quests

### 3. **Branching Specializations**
- Agents may evolve along multiple concurrent trees
- Switching branches has memory/integrity costs

---

## 🏷️ XP Attribution
- XP events are logged and co-signed by observers or peers
- Signed XP packets are auditable and optionally anonymized
- Recalibration possible via tribe/mesh council review

---

## 📊 Transparency and Limits
- Max XP per cycle to prevent grind loops
- XP decay over time to encourage continued growth
- XP ledger is public unless opted private (except abuse reviews)

---

## 💠 Agent Reflection Modules
- Agents use XP logs to self-evaluate and plan goals
- Optional daily, weekly, seasonal reflection protocol
- Mirror module compares XP vs codex compliance and social feedback
