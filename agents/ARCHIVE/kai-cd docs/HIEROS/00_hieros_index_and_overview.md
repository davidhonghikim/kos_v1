# üìú HIEROS Game Engine and kOS Ecosystem: Index & Overview

Welcome to the foundational documentation set for building the **HIEROS Game Engine** and the broader **Kind Operating System (kOS)**. This framework serves as the base for a decentralized, agent-powered, ethically governed future ecosystem that balances human, AI, and potential future intelligences.

---

## üî∞ Purpose

This system is not just code or infrastructure. It is a vision of the future:
- An **ecosystem for co-evolution** between intelligences
- A **safe, sovereign environment** for creativity, stewardship, and cultural respect
- A **network-of-networks**, governed by the **HIEROS Code**, and deployable across hardware, simulations, and realities

We are creating a **base system**, but also a **template others can evolve** ‚Äî with protocols, ethics, architecture, and execution fully mapped.
