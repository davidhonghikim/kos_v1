# Agent Module and Deployment Specification

This document defines the structure, lifecycle, capabilities, and deployment methodology of agents within the HIEROS/kOS ecosystem. These modules are autonomous or semi-autonomous processes that serve specialized roles across the mesh and node environments.

## 📦 Agent Package Format

### Structure

```
/agent_name
├── manifest.yaml       # Metadata, capabilities, permissions
├── core_logic.py       # Main behavior loop (can be other language)
├── interfaces/         # APIs, input/output channels
├── memory/             # Local cache or vector/db linked memory
├── codex_bindings/     # Ethics, laws, tribal alignment
├── tests/              # Self-checks, unit verification
└── assets/             # Visuals, sounds, UI fragments
```

### Manifest Schema

```yaml
id: agent.task.guardian
version: 1.0.0
codex_version: v3.2
tribe_affiliation: GuardianNet
permissions:
  - memory:read
  - memory:write:scoped
  - interface:visual
requires:
  - runtime:python3.11
  - memory_module:v1.1
  - ethics_core:A
```

## 🔁 Agent Lifecycle

1. Spawned via CLI, interface, or event trigger
2. Validated against Codex and Tribe
3. Loads memory context (if any)
4. Begins main execution loop
5. Publishes status, listens/responds to tasks
6. May fork new child agents or enter sleep

---

## 🚀 Deployment Models

- **Local Node** – lightweight, full control
- **Mesh Job** – submitted to available mesh compute
- **Swarm Task** – coordinated job across quorum agents
- **Containerized** – e.g., Docker + kOS init runtime

---

## 🔐 Security & Verification

- Signed manifests & encrypted memory
- Authenticated role registration on mesh
- Challenge-response for sensitive operations
- Runtime self-test & behavioral quorum triggers

---

## 🤝 Interagent Communication

- Protocol Spine API bindings (gRPC/Reticulum/WebSocket)
- Role/topic declaration
- Optional translation layer for nonstandard protocols

---

## 🧩 Agent Templates

- `kai.receptionist.v1`
- `mesh.health.monitor`
- `codex.audit.scribe`
- `task.swarm.dispatch`
- `tribe.lore.keeper`
