# 🧠 07\_HIEROS Protocol Spine

This document defines the communication backbone and coordination substrate of the HIEROS/kOS ecosystem. It ensures all entities — human, AI, hybrid — can exchange data, intentions, and state safely, transparently, and adaptively.

---

## 🔗 Purpose

To provide a resilient, flexible, and ethical protocol layer that supports:

- Agent-to-agent communication
- Governance operations
- Memory queries and syncing
- Modular consensus algorithms
- Local-first fallbacks and planetary-scale federation

---

## 📡 Core Layers

### 1. **Handshake Layer**

- Identity validation
- Codex compliance check
- Declaration of intent
- Optional mutual consent handshake

### 2. **Message Layer**

- Structured, semantic message types (YAML/JSON hybrid)
- Every message carries:
  - Origin + signature
  - Intent (ask / tell / suggest / sync / log / revoke)
  - Scope (private, tribe, public, intersystem)
  - Expiry + persistence level

### 3. **Governance Layer**

- Supports:
  - Liquid democratic voting
  - Consent arbitration
  - Role delegation
  - Emergency overrides (with multi-party approval)

### 4. **Sync Layer**

- Built-in support for:
  - CRDTs for shared worlds/states
  - Git-style branching + merging of agent memory
  - Selective forking + reintegration

### 5. **Security Layer**

- All messages cryptographically signed
- Metadata separation for privacy
- Throttled message rate to prevent spam/flood
- Logs can be ephemeral, local-only, tribe-shared, or global

---

## 🛠️ Supported Transports

- WebSocket / WebRTC
- IPFS pubsub
- LoRa / Meshnet protocols
- Encrypted local sockets (for embedded systems)

---

## ⚖️ Failover & Conflict Resolution

- Built-in quorum and timestamp arbitration
- Agents escalate to governance layer on disagreement
- Disputes may be:
  - Logged and voted on
  - Paused until quorum
  - Resolved by special neutral agents

---

## 🧪 Example Message Format

```yaml
origin: kai_companion_007
intent: sync
scope: tribe
payload:
  memory_patch:
    - key: dream_logs.2025.06.23
      value: "I watched the sea become glass."
expiry: 24h
codex_signature: true
```

---

## 🔄 Protocol Evolution

- Versioned schema and auto-upgraders
- Experimental lanes for protocol research
- Optional inter-protocol translators
