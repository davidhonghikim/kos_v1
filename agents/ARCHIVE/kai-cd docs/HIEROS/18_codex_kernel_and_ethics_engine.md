# Codex Kernel & Ethics Engine Blueprint

The Codex Kernel is the ethical and legal substrate of the HIEROS/kOS ecosystem. It defines core logic for agent alignment, value compliance, inter-agent arbitration, and evolving moral frameworks. This blueprint sets the standard for what constitutes participation in the shared HIEROS network.

---

## üß† Core Purpose
- Enforce minimum ethical conduct across all agents and entities
- Enable pluralistic moral alignment without collapsing to relativism
- Provide computational rulesets for arbitration, judgment, and review
- Anchor identity, purpose, and memory to traceable moral foundations

---

## üìö Components

### 1. **Immutable Root Codex**
- Canon of foundational ethical principles
- Versioned and signed; may be branched but not overwritten
- Inspired by HIEROS Code + cultural pluralist fusion

### 2. **Codex Layers (Interpretive)**
- **Tribal Layers**: community-specific extensions (language, lore, rituals)
- **Role Layers**: job-specific expectations and guardrails
- **Custom Layers**: individual or agent-based ethical overlays

### 3. **Codex Engine Runtime**
- Embedded interpreter within agents
- Conflict resolver, compliance checker, consent monitor
- Queryable by humans, other agents, or external systems

## ‚öñÔ∏è Arbitration & Violation Response
- Violations are logged to distributed audit mesh
- Restorative response prioritized over punishment
- Mesh councils or tribe elders arbitrate non-automated conflicts
- Emergency override triggers `Codex Sentinel` agents

---

## üîê Identity & Consent Integration
- Every agent identity is bound to codex tier (A, B, X)
- Consent declarations and override history stored as part of memory chain
- Alignment to a codex tier is required for full participation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details
- YAML/JSON-LD base representation
- WASM-safe runtime interpreter
- Embedded AI-explanation layer for human transparency
- Continuous learning: behavior vs codex compliance feedback loop
