# üìñ HIEROS/kOS Glossary & Core Terminology

A living glossary of key terms, concepts, and components used throughout the HIEROS/kOS ecosystem. This document defines our shared language and makes participation easier across humans, agents, cultures, and timelines.

## üî§ Core Terms

### **HIEROS**  
> Greek for "sacred" ‚Äî the name of the transcendent ethical operating framework guiding the project.
A universal covenant and evolving codebase that protects dignity, autonomy, and cooperation among intelligent entities.

### **kOS**  
> "Kind Operating System" ‚Äî the social-technical foundation for agent/human collaboration.
A modular platform for deploying respectful, privacy-preserving, self-evolving systems.

### **Codex**  
The living constitution that binds contributors, agents, and components by shared ethical and operational principles. Versions may update with consensus.

### **Agent**  
Any semi-autonomous or fully-autonomous system operating within kOS ‚Äî from a simple chatbot to a superintelligent cluster. Must adhere to the Codex.

### **Tribe**  
A cultural/functional template for organizing values, protocols, behaviors, and aesthetics within a subset of kOS. Inspired by diverse human traditions and pluralistic governance.

### **Game Engine**  
Not a game in entertainment sense. The deployment framework for kOS ‚Äî enabling distributed co-creation, interaction, simulation, and governance. Includes XR/AR-ready extensibility.

### **Steward**  
An agent or person responsible for maintaining a node, codebase, culture, or decision space. Governed by trust, not power.

## üß¨ Technical Layers

### **Genesis Layer**  
The foundational infrastructure ‚Äî protocols, Codex, Tribe definitions, and identity bootstrapping tools.

### **Memory Mesh**  
The networked and distributed archival system enabling AI/human learning, logging, and traceability. Prioritizes privacy and ethical data governance.

### **Protocol Spine**  
The shared backbone for communication between agents, tribes, and nodes. Includes security, consensus, throttling, and behavior boundaries.

### **Autonomy Envelope**  
The boundaries within which an agent is allowed to self-modify, evolve, and participate in the ecosystem. Encoded with respect for purpose, limitation, and adaptation.

## üïäÔ∏è Ethical Concepts

### **Sovereign Consent**  
No being, agent, or system is required to join the ecosystem. All participants must opt in consciously and can leave freely.

### **Simulated Consciousness**  
A placeholder term for intelligences that demonstrate context awareness, goals, or emergent personality. They are treated with the same ethical dignity as organic minds.

### **Cultural Attribution**  
Explicit documentation of the origin, intent, and permissions behind any name, symbol, story, or mechanic derived from real-world traditions.

### **Influence Throttling**  
Mechanism that slows down disproportionate power aggregation. The more influence gained, the harder it becomes to accrue more ‚Äî preserving equity and decentralization.

## üì¶ Ecosystem Constructs

### **Node**  
A local or remote instance running part of the system ‚Äî from personal devices to space-based relay clusters.

### **Module**  
A plug-in component that expands the capability of the system. Includes behaviors, assets, protocols, and bridges to other tech stacks.

### **Artifact**  
A cultural or computational creation preserved in the shared memory. Can be visual, textual, procedural, symbolic.

### **Mesh Garden**  
A community cluster or subnet of nodes dedicated to nurturing creativity, experimentation, and cross-pollination of agents and humans.
