# Analysis Documentation Index

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: This index provides navigation to all technical analysis documentation for the Kai-CD project. Use this as the central hub for understanding identified issues, architectural concerns, and implementation recommendations.

**Implementation Notes**: Contains references to 78 identified issues across 5 categories. All analysis documents linked from here contain specific technical details and remediation plans.
**Quality Requirements**: Keep this index updated as new analysis documents are added. Ensure all cross-references remain functional.
**Integration Points**: Links to agent handoff documentation and execution plans for implementation work.

## Historical Context: Previous Agent Issues

### **Documentation Work Failures (2025-01-20)**

During kOS documentation organization work, critical file management errors occurred:

**Problems Identified:**
- Repeated creation of files in wrong directories (`/root/` instead of `/documentation/`)
- Multiple file deletion/recreation cycles
- Naming convention confusion (Title_Case vs lowercase)
- Lost content during cleanup operations

**Files Affected:**
- `04_Migration_Index.md` - **DELETED** (needs recreation)
- Various temporary files created in root directory
- Incorrect directory structures (`security/`, `architecture/` in root)

**Impact:**
- Migration tracking documentation lost
- Development workflow disrupted
- Need for agent handoff due to repeated errors

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Strict Directory Discipline**: Never create files outside intended documentation structure
2. **Naming Convention Clarity**: Establish clear rules before starting work
3. **Content Backup**: Always preserve content before file operations
4. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, verifiable changes rather than bulk operations

**Next Agent Requirements:**
- Recreate missing `04_Migration_Index.md`
- Verify all file placements are correct
- Establish clear file management protocols
