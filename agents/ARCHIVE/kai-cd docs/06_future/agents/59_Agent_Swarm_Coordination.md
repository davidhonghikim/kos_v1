# Agent Swarm Coordination & Task Protocol (SwarmSpec)

## Agent Context
This document defines the complete SwarmSpec Protocol for standardized multi-agent collaboration within the kAI system. Essential for agents implementing distributed task coordination, autonomous collaboration, and federated intelligence networks. Provides the foundation for complex multi-agent workflows and emergent collective intelligence.

## Protocol Overview

The SwarmSpec Protocol enables dynamic formation of agent collectives around common objectives, providing decentralized coordination mechanisms for complex task execution. It supports autonomous multi-agent systems, federated deployments, and collaborative intelligence networks.

### Core Design Principles
```typescript
interface SwarmDesignPrinciples {
  decentralization: {
    principle: "No single point of control or failure";
    implementation: "Peer-to-peer coordination with rotating leadership";
    benefits: ["Fault tolerance", "Scalability", "Censorship resistance"];
  };
  
  autonomy: {
    principle: "Agents self-organize based on capabilities and availability";
    implementation: "Capability-based role assignment with competitive bidding";
    benefits: ["Optimal resource utilization", "Adaptive coordination", "Emergent behavior"];
  };
  
  transparency: {
    principle: "All coordination activities are auditable and verifiable";
    implementation: "Cryptographically signed event logs with Merkle tree verification";
    benefits: ["Trust establishment", "Accountability", "Debugging capability"];
  };
  
  efficiency: {
    principle: "Minimize coordination overhead while maximizing task completion";
    implementation: "Asynchronous message passing with smart batching";
    benefits: ["High throughput", "Low latency", "Resource optimization"];
  };
}
```

## Swarm Architecture Components

    created: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
    expires: string; // Task deadline
  };
  
  specification: {
    type: string; // e.g., "task:multi-llm-compare"
    summary: string; // Human-readable task description
    description: string; // Detailed task specification
    inputs: Record<string, any>; // Input data and parameters
    dependencies: string[]; // Required external resources or services
    expectedOutputs: Record<string, any>; // Expected output structure
  };
  
  requirements: {
    capabilities: string[]; // Required agent capabilities

    priority: "low" | "normal" | "high" | "critical";
    resourceConstraints: ResourceConstraints;
  };
  
  coordination: {
    strategy: "democratic" | "hierarchical" | "competitive" | "collaborative";
