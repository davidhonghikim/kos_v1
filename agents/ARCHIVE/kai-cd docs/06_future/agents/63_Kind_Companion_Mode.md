# Kind Companion Mode (kAI Embedded Presence System)

This document defines the architecture, features, and technical design of **Kind Companion Mode (KCM)**, the embedded AI presence mode of `kAI` that enables ongoing assistance, social bonding, and proactive support in mobile, wearable, and ambient systems.

## Agent Context

**For AI Agents**: KCM represents the always-on companion interface. Implement the presence detection, memory continuity, and proactive engagement systems as specified. This is the primary user-facing personality layer.

**Implementation Priority**: Core user experience feature - implement memory layer first, then presence detection, then proactive systems.

---

## I. Purpose & Scope

KCM aims to:

- Embed `kAI` into the user's life contextually and emotionally
- Enable proactive, background support
- Support always-on, privacy-respecting local agent presence
- Facilitate long-term relationship memory and emotional continuity

## II. Use Modes

### A. Mobile Companion

- On-device AI app (Android/iOS)
- Supports background processing, voice wake-word, and gesture triggers

### B. Wearable Presence

- Smartwatch or wearable device agent
- Heart rate, motion, stress detection
- Audio/visual feedback via vibration, speech, haptics

### C. Ambient Companion

- Smart speaker, home robot, screen or device
- Always-on, room-aware agent mode
- Scene-based proactive engagement

## III. Core Features

### A. Memory & Continuity

- Long-term relationship memory stored locally (encrypted)
- Emotional tone tracking (affect model)
- Event reflection and reminders

### B. Proactive Support System

- Context monitor (calendar, location, habits)
- Alert/responder layer for safety and attention
- Daily summaries, mood check-ins, creative prompts

### C. Presence Feedback

- Light/sound/haptic patterns based on context
- Visual avatar or agent projection (AR optional)
- Emotional mirroring engine

### D. Custom Personality Layer

- User-defined traits or imported templates
- Mood-aware agent modulation
- Mode switching: silly, serious, coach, friend

```

## V. Privacy & Security

- Local-only memory and emotional logs
- No streaming of audio unless explicitly triggered
- Wake-word and gesture activation
- Vault-style encryption of mood, memory, and biometric logs
- Emergency override passphrase

## VI. Integration Points

- kOS Service Mesh: Proactive alerting, calendar sync, emergency routing
- kAI Core: Shared personality, memory persistence, and command routing
- KLP Protocol: Presence discovery and trust handshake for ambient devices

## VII. Future Features

| Feature                           | Planned Version |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| AR Agent Hologram (ARCore/Vision) | v1.1            |
| Voice mirroring & emotional sync  | v1.2            |
| Relationship milestone tracker    | v1.3            |
| AI pet/creature co-mode           | v1.5            |
| Shared multi-user companion mesh  | v2.0            |
