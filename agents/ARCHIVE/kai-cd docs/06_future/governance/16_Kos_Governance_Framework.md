# kOS Governance Framework

## Agent Context
This document defines the complete governance architecture for kOS, including hybrid decentralized governance (HDG), trust scoring systems, voting mechanisms, and conflict resolution protocols. Critical for agents implementing governance modules, trust evaluation systems, and community management features.

## Overview

The kOS governance framework implements a **Hybrid Decentralized Governance (HDG)** model that combines local autonomy, federated trust layers, and global consensus mechanisms to create a robust, scalable governance system for the decentralized Kind Operating System.

## Architecture Components

### Governance Layers

The governance system operates on three distinct layers, each with specific autonomy levels and decision-making mechanisms:

1. **Node Level**: Configurable, autonomous policies per operator
2. **Community Layer**: Groups of nodes form federations, define shared norms  
3. **Network Level**: Root protocol decisions, software upgrades, threat responses

### Role System

```typescript
interface Role {
  name: string;
  permissions: Permission[];
  inheritance: Role[];
  delegation: DelegationRules;
  expiration?: Date;
}

const roleHierarchy = {
  user: {
    permissions: ['participate', 'publish', 'vote'],
    inheritance: [],
    delegation: { allowed: false }
  },
  moderator: {
    permissions: ['flag_content', 'remove_content', 'apply_restrictions'],
    inheritance: ['user'],
    delegation: { allowed: true, max_depth: 1 }
  },
  custodian: {
    permissions: ['configure_policy', 'assign_roles', 'manage_agents'],
    inheritance: ['moderator'],
    delegation: { allowed: true, max_depth: 2 }
  },
  arbiter: {
    permissions: ['mediate_disputes', 'hold_consensus_keys'],
    inheritance: ['custodian'],
    delegation: { allowed: false }
  },
  core_dev: {
    permissions: ['propose_protocol_updates', 'sign_releases'],
    inheritance: ['arbiter'],
    delegation: { allowed: false }
  }
};
```

## Trust System

### Trust Score Calculation

Trust scores range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are calculated using multiple weighted factors:

- **Uptime/Participation** (20%): Frequency and consistency of participation
- **Moderation Reports** (25%): Ratio of reports filed vs. received
- **Endorsements** (20%): Trust endorsements from verified community members
- **Behavior Analysis** (20%): Rate limits, toxicity analysis, helpfulness metrics
- **Historical Reputation** (15%): Long-term reputation anchors and milestones

### Reputation Anchors

Public, cryptographically verified logs of notable events including:
- Elections to federation roles
- Successful dispute resolutions
- Protocol contributions
- Trust milestones achieved

## Proposal and Voting System

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Authored locally or via federation DAO
2. **Published**: Timestamped and visible to eligible voters
3. **Active Vote**: Specific time window for voting
4. **Finalized**: Adopted or rejected based on results

### Voting Methods

- **Quadratic Voting**: Default method preventing vote buying
- **Simple Majority**: Basic democratic decision-making
- **Delegated Stake Voting**: Via KLP with role-based weights
- **Ranked Choice**: For complex multi-option proposals

### Proposal Types

| Type | Scope | Binding | Example |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| local-policy | Node/Federation | Yes | Moderation rules |
| agent-behavior | Core agents | Yes | Agent constraints |
| protocol-upgrade | Global software | Yes | Version updates |
| social-contract | Community values | Optional | Code of conduct |

## Dispute Resolution System

### Three-Tier Resolution

1. **Local Disputes**: Handled by moderators and custodians
2. **Federation Conflicts**: Arbitrated by elected arbiter quorum
3. **Network-Level Conflicts**: Emergency measures via root proposals

### Evidence Standards

- Timestamped logs with cryptographic integrity
- KID-verified statements and testimonies
- Screenshots and interaction records
- Behavioral pattern analysis

## Federation Templates

### Governance Modules

Pre-configured governance templates for different use cases:

- **Civic Democracy**: Majority voting, transparent logs, minimal moderation
- **Council Governance**: Role-weighted quorum model for structured organizations
- **Open Community**: Moderation-enabled with trust score access control

## Security Considerations

### Anti-Abuse Mechanisms

- Role abuse prevention via revocation and audit alerts
- Sybil attack mitigation through decentralized identity weighting
- Federation split protection requiring 2/3 quorum
- Multi-signature validation for protocol upgrades

### Audit and Transparency

- Cryptographic action logs with Merkle tree proof chains
- Public transparency portals for vote outcomes and decisions
- Regular governance health assessments
- Community oversight mechanisms

## Implementation Guidelines

### Integration Points

1. **Agent Decision Systems**: Governance modules integrate with agent reasoning
2. **Trust Evaluation**: Scores influence interaction permissions and capabilities
3. **Automated Participation**: Agents can participate through programmatic interfaces
4. **Conflict Prevention**: Automated monitoring and early intervention systems

### Performance Considerations

- Trust score calculations cached with appropriate TTL
- Efficient vote aggregation algorithms for large communities
- Automated dispute triage and routing
- Lazy loading of federation templates and configurations
