# kOS Governance Framework

> **Agent Context**: Complete governance architecture for distributed kOS system  
> **Implementation**: ðŸŽ¯ Future vision - Hybrid decentralized governance with trust scoring  
> **Use When**: Planning governance systems, implementing consensus, understanding distributed coordination

## Quick Summary
Complete governance architecture for future kOS distributed system with Hybrid Decentralized Governance model combining local autonomy with federated trust and global consensus protocols.

## Overview

The kOS Governance Framework establishes a **Hybrid Decentralized Governance (HDG)** model that combines local autonomy with federated trust and optional global consensus. This enables scalable governance across individual nodes, communities, and the broader kOS network.

### Core Principles

- **Local Autonomy**: Each kOS node maintains authority over its own space
- **Federated Trust**: Shared standards and APIs for consensus and moderation
- **Global Consensus**: Optional network-wide proposals and updates
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: All governance actions are signed and auditable

## Governance Layers

### 1. Node Level
- **Scope**: Individual kOS installations
- **Authority**: Node operator (custodian role)
- **Decisions**: Local policies, agent behavior, resource allocation
- **Implementation**: Configuration files, local rule engines

### 2. Community Layer (Federations)
- **Scope**: Groups of cooperating nodes
- **Authority**: Elected moderators and arbiters
- **Decisions**: Shared norms, cross-node protocols, dispute resolution
- **Implementation**: Federation contracts, shared governance modules

### 3. Network Level
- **Scope**: Global kOS protocol
- **Authority**: Core developers and elected representatives
- **Decisions**: Protocol upgrades, security responses, standards
- **Implementation**: Network-wide consensus mechanisms

## Role Hierarchy

### Core Roles

| Role | Permissions | Scope |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `user` | Participate, publish, vote (trust-gated) | Local/Federation |
| `moderator` | Content moderation, temporary restrictions | Local/Federation |
| `custodian` | Node configuration, role assignment, agent management | Node |
| `arbiter` | Cross-node dispute resolution, consensus validation | Federation |
| `core-dev` | Protocol updates, security patches | Network |
| `founder` | Historical privileges, legacy governance | Federation |

### Role Inheritance
- Hierarchical permission inheritance (e.g., custodian > moderator)
- Delegation via signed role grants using KLP
- Time-limited and revocable credentials
- Multi-signature requirements for critical roles

## Trust System Architecture

### Trust Score Components

**Range**: 0.0 (untrusted) to 1.0 (maximum trust)

**Factors**:
- **Uptime & Participation**: Consistent network presence and engagement
- **Moderation History**: Reports filed vs. received, accuracy of flags
- **Peer Endorsements**: Signed recommendations from trusted entities
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Rate limiting compliance, helpfulness metrics
- **Task Completion**: Success rates, reliability in commitments

### Trust Score Calculation

```typescript
interface TrustScore {
  subject: KindID;
  score: number; // 0.0 - 1.0
  components: {
    uptime: number;
    moderation: number;
    endorsements: number;
    behavior: number;
    completion: number;
  };
  lastUpdated: timestamp;
  decay: number; // decay rate without activity
}
```

### Reputation Anchors
- **Public Ledger**: Cryptographically signed log of notable events
- **Milestone Events**: Elections, dispute resolutions, major contributions
- **Cross-Network Verification**: KID signature validation across nodes
- **Chain of Trust**: Local node â†’ federation â†’ network root certificate

## Proposal & Voting System

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Authored locally or via federation DAO
2. **Published**: Timestamped and visible to eligible voters
3. **Active Vote**: Defined time window for vote collection
4. **Finalized**: Adopted, rejected, or deferred based on results

### Voting Methods

- **Quadratic Voting**: Default method, prevents vote buying
- **Simple Majority**: For routine decisions
- **Delegated Stake**: Via KLP delegation mechanisms
- **Ranked Choice**: For multi-option decisions

### Proposal Types

| Type | Scope | Binding | Quorum |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| `local-policy` | Node/Federation | Yes | 50%+1 |
| `agent-behavior` | Core agents | Yes | 66% |
| `protocol-upgrade` | Network-wide | Yes | 75% |
| `social-contract` | Community values | Advisory | 40% |

## Dispute Resolution Framework

### Local Disputes
- **Handlers**: Moderators and custodians
- **Process**: Flagged content review with timestamped logs
- **Actions**: Warnings, timeouts, shadowbans, escalation
- **Appeals**: Automated review process with human oversight

### Federation Conflicts
- **Arbiters**: Elected quorum with rotating keys
- **Evidence**: Standardized format with KID verification
- **Rulings**: Signed public reports with resolution timeline
- **Enforcement**: Coordinated action across federation nodes

### Network-Level Conflicts
- **Triggers**: Security threats, protocol violations, rogue nodes
- **Process**: Emergency proposal with expedited voting
- **Timeline**: 6-24 hours based on severity
- **Actions**: Quarantine, revocation, emergency patches

## Auditing & Transparency

### Action Logs
Every governance action is cryptographically logged:

```typescript
interface GovernanceLog {
  actor: KindID;
  timestamp: string;
  action: string;
  target: string;
  evidence: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

### Transparency Portals
Optional public dashboards showing:
- Vote outcomes and participation
- Agent audit trails
- Role assignments and changes
- Open proposals and discussions

## Federation Templates

### Predefined Governance Modules

| Template | Features | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `civic-demo` | Majority voting, transparent logs | Small communities |
| `council-vote` | Role-weighted quorum | Academic/enterprise |
| `default-open` | Moderation-enabled, trust-gated | Public nodes |
| `enterprise` | Hierarchical approval, audit trails | Corporate deployments |

## Security Considerations

### Attack Prevention
- **Role Abuse**: Revocation mechanisms and audit alerts
- **Sybil Attacks**: Decentralized identity weighting
- **Federation Splits**: 2/3 quorum required for configuration forks
- **Upgrade Validation**: Multi-signature verification from core developers

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- All governance actions signed with Ed25519
- Merkle tree proof chains for audit logs
- KLP-based secure communication between nodes
- Optional blockchain anchoring for critical decisions

- Single-user Chrome extension
- Local configuration management
- No governance mechanisms
- Basic service management

### Transition Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Implement local governance for agent behavior
2. **Phase 2**: Add federation capabilities for multi-user scenarios
3. **Phase 3**: Network-level governance for protocol decisions
4. **Phase 4**: Full decentralized governance with cryptographic guarantees

### Bridge Components
- Configuration system evolution (current â†’ federated)
- Service management â†’ agent governance
- Local preferences â†’ community consensus
- Manual oversight â†’ automated governance
