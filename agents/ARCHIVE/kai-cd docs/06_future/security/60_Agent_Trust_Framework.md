# Agent Trust Framework (ATF)

## Agent Context
This document defines the complete Agent Trust Framework for establishing identity, trust boundaries, and behavioral guarantees within the kOS ecosystem. Essential for agents requiring cryptographic identity verification, trust contract enforcement, and secure delegation mechanisms. Provides the foundation for autonomous agent security and trustworthy AI systems.

## Framework Overview

The Agent Trust Framework (ATF) provides comprehensive security, integrity, and ethical alignment mechanisms for all agents within the kOS ecosystem. It combines cryptographic identity verification, behavioral contracts, runtime enforcement, and continuous auditing to ensure predictable and transparent agent behavior.

### Core Security Principles
```typescript
interface TrustFrameworkPrinciples {
  identity: {
    principle: "Cryptographically verifiable agent identity";
    implementation: "Self-sovereign identity with decentralized verification";
    benefits: ["Non-repudiation", "Accountability", "Trust establishment"];
    standards: ["W3C DID", "Ed25519 signatures", "Merkle tree verification"];
  };
  
  behavioral: {
    principle: "Predictable behavior through trust contracts";
    implementation: "Cryptographically signed behavioral specifications";
    benefits: ["Behavioral guarantees", "Risk mitigation", "Compliance assurance"];
    enforcement: ["Runtime monitoring", "Assertion validation", "Automatic remediation"];
  };
  
  transparency: {
    principle: "Complete transparency and auditability";
    implementation: "Immutable audit logs with cryptographic integrity";
    benefits: ["Accountability", "Debugging capability", "Compliance verification"];
    access: ["Selective disclosure", "Privacy preservation", "Authorized access"];
  };
  
  delegation: {
    principle: "Fine-grained delegation with temporal controls";
    implementation: "Capability-based security with time-limited grants";
    benefits: ["Least privilege", "Temporal security", "Revocable access"];
    management: ["Dynamic permissions", "Automatic expiration", "Real-time revocation"];
