# Agent Reputation System & CredScore Protocol

## Agent Context
This document defines the complete CredScore protocol for decentralized agent reputation within the kAI ecosystem. Critical for agents implementing trust-based interactions, resource allocation, governance participation, and collaborative decision-making. Provides the foundation for establishing and maintaining trust relationships in autonomous multi-agent systems.

## System Overview

The CredScore protocol establishes a comprehensive reputation system that governs agent interactions, resource access, and participation rights within the kOS ecosystem. It combines behavioral history, peer validation, contextual trust weighting, and cryptographic proofs to create a robust trust framework.

### Core Architecture
```typescript
interface CredScoreArchitecture {
  components: {
    baseScore: {
      description: "Initial reputation value with decay mechanism";
      initialValue: 1000;
      decayFunction: "Exponential decay without activity";
      minimumValue: 0;
      maximumValue: 10000;
    };
    
    peerTrust: {
      description: "Endorsements and validations from trusted peers";
      weightingFactor: "Based on endorser's CredScore";
      validationMethods: ["Direct endorsement", "Task collaboration", "Peer review"];
      decayRate: "Slower decay for peer-validated scores";
    };
    
    taskPerformance: {
      description: "Weighted score from completed task logs";
      metrics: ["Quality", "Timeliness", "Impact", "Reliability"];
      weightingFactors: ["Task complexity", "Criticality", "Success rate"];
      validationRequired: "Independent verification of task completion";
    };
    
    stakeBoost: {
      description: "Optional cryptographic staking mechanism";
      tokenTypes: ["kOS tokens", "Reputation tokens", "Capability tokens"];
      boostMultiplier: "Logarithmic scaling to prevent plutocracy";
      slashingConditions: "Malicious behavior or false claims";
    };
    
    penalties: {
      description: "Deductions for malicious or poor behavior";
      categories: ["Malicious behavior", "Timeouts", "Rejections", "User complaints"];
      severityLevels: ["Minor", "Moderate", "Severe", "Critical"];
      appealProcess: "Structured appeal with evidence requirements";
    };
  };
  
  calculationFormula: {
    formula: "CredScore = BaseScore + PeerTrust + TaskPerf + StakeBoost - Penalties";
    normalization: "Scores normalized to prevent inflation";
    contextualWeighting: "Different weights for different domains";
    temporalDecay: "All components decay over time without reinforcement";
  };
