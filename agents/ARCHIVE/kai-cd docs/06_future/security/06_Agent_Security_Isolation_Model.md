# Agent Security Model and Isolation Controls

> **Agent Context**: Complete agent isolation framework ensuring secure execution environments with capability-based access control  
> **Implementation**: üî¨ Planned - Advanced sandboxing system requiring containerization and runtime security infrastructure  
> **Use When**: Implementing agent execution environments, permission systems, or security monitoring

## Quick Summary
Technical blueprint for enforcing agent-level security, isolation, and sandboxing across Kind AI (kAI) agents and their interactions within the Kind OS (kOS) runtime environment.

## Core Security Principles

### **Agent Isolation Goals**
- Each agent operates within a secure, controlled execution environment
- Agents cannot access or interfere with other agents' memory, state, or privileges
- Agent capabilities are explicitly declared and enforced at runtime
- Runtime security events are auditable and traceable

## Implementation Architecture

### **Agent Permission Model**

```typescript
// Comprehensive permission system with capability-based access control
interface AgentPermission {
  agentId: string;
  capabilities: AgentCapabilitySet;
  resourceLimits: ResourceLimits;
  environmentIsolation: IsolationLevel;
  signedBy: string;               // DID of permission grantor
  signature: string;              // Cryptographic signature
  issuedAt: Date;
}

interface AgentCapabilitySet {
  fileSystem: 'none' | 'read' | 'write' | 'full';
  network: 'none' | 'inbound' | 'outbound' | 'full';
  memory: 'none' | 'read' | 'write' | 'full';
  subprocess: boolean;
  vectorDb: boolean;
  llm: boolean;
}

enum IsolationLevel {
  SANDBOXED = 'sandboxed',
  NATIVE = 'native',
  EXTERNAL = 'external'
}

class AgentPermissionEnforcer {
  private permissions: Map<string, AgentPermission> = new Map();
  
  async checkPermission(
    agentId: string,
    capability: string,
    context: PermissionContext
  ): Promise<PermissionCheckResult> {
    const permission = this.permissions.get(agentId);
    if (!permission) {
      return {
        allowed: false,
        reason: 'No permissions found for agent'
      };
    }
    
    // Check specific capability
    return this.checkSpecificCapability(permission, capability, context);
  }
}
```

## For AI Agents

### When to Use Agent Security Model
- ‚úÖ **Untrusted agent execution** requiring complete isolation from system resources
- ‚úÖ **Multi-tenant environments** where agents from different users must be isolated
- ‚úÖ **High-security deployments** requiring comprehensive audit trails
- ‚ùå Don't use full isolation for simple, trusted internal agent operations

### Key Implementation Points
- **Capability-based access control** with explicit permission verification
- **Multi-level isolation** supporting different security requirements
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with real-time security event detection
- **Resource management** preventing resource exhaustion attacks
