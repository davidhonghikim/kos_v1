# Memory Architecture

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: Complete memory architecture system covering service-level memory management and evolution to sophisticated distributed memory systems. Use this when implementing memory systems, understanding storage patterns, planning memory architecture, or building data persistence systems. Essential foundation for all memory and storage work.

**Implementation Notes**: Contains memory architecture patterns, storage systems, persistence mechanisms, and evolution to distributed memory management. Includes working memory patterns and storage coordination systems.
**Quality Requirements**: Keep memory architecture patterns and storage systems synchronized with actual implementation. Maintain accuracy of memory management and persistence mechanisms.
**Integration Points**: Foundation for memory management, links to core memory architecture, data persistence, and future distributed memory systems for comprehensive memory coverage.

## Quick Summary
Multi-tiered memory architecture providing storage and retrieval across different time scales and contexts, supporting current Kai-CD functionality and future kOS agent mesh capabilities.

## Overview

The memory architecture provides a multi-tiered system for storing and retrieving information across different time scales and contexts. The system is designed to support both current Kai-CD functionality and future kOS agent mesh capabilities.
