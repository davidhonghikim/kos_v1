# Agent Orchestration Architecture

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: Complete agent orchestration architecture covering evolution from current service management to sophisticated agent mesh orchestration. Use this when implementing agent lifecycle management, planning multi-agent coordination, or understanding orchestration patterns. Critical foundation for all agent coordination work.

**Implementation Notes**: Contains current service orchestration patterns and future comprehensive agent mesh with lifecycle management, security framework, and communication protocols. Includes working TypeScript interfaces and deployment patterns.
**Quality Requirements**: Keep orchestration patterns and agent lifecycle management concepts accurate. Maintain synchronization with actual service management implementation.
**Integration Points**: Foundation for agent coordination, links to service architecture, workflow management, and future distributed agent systems.

## Quick Summary
Complete orchestration blueprint covering evolution from current service coordination to sophisticated agent mesh orchestration with lifecycle management, deployment patterns, and communication protocols.

## Overview

The Agent Orchestration Architecture defines how autonomous agents are managed, coordinated, and executed across the Kai-CD to kOS evolution. This system provides the foundation for multi-agent workflows, distributed computing, and intelligent task delegation.

## Current Implementation: Service Orchestration

### Service Management Foundation
The current system provides basic orchestration through the service management layer:

```typescript
// Current service orchestration in serviceStore.ts
interface ServiceDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'llm' | 'image' | 'vector' | 'utility';
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'error';
  capabilities: string[];
  endpoints: ServiceEndpoint[];
  auth: AuthConfig;
}

// Service lifecycle management
const serviceStore = create<ServiceStore>((set, get) => ({
  services: new Map(),
  
  async addService(definition: ServiceDefinition) {
    // Validate and register service
    await this.validateService(definition);
    this.services.set(definition.id, definition);
    await this.healthCheck(definition.id);
  },
  
  async executeServiceCall(serviceId: string, endpoint: string, params: any) {
    // Route and execute service requests
    const service = this.services.get(serviceId);
    return await apiClient.makeRequest(service, endpoint, params);
  }
}));
```

### Current Orchestration Patterns
1. **Static Service Registry**: Predefined service definitions
2. **Capability-Based Routing**: Route requests based on service capabilities  
3. **Health Monitoring**: Basic availability checks
4. **Configuration Management**: Centralized service configuration
5. **Error Handling**: Retry logic and fallback mechanisms

## Future Vision: kOS Agent Mesh

### Agent Lifecycle Management

The future kOS system implements comprehensive agent lifecycle orchestration with nine distinct stages:

1. **Definition**: Developer creates manifest and capability profile
2. **Registration**: Agent registered with system orchestrator
3. **Activation**: Agent loaded into runtime and sandboxed
4. **Handshake**: Agent advertises profile to registry
5. **Execution**: Agent responds to task contracts
6. **Upgrade**: Orchestrator triggers updates
7. **Quarantine**: Misbehaving agents isolated
8. **Termination**: Agent destroyed and memory cleared
9. **Audit**: Final logs stored in audit trail

### Agent Runtime Environment

Every agent runs in a containerized environment with strict isolation:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /agent
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 agent
USER agent
CMD ["python", "entrypoint.py"]
```

Container policies enforce resource limits (CPU: 1 core, RAM: 512MB default) and security constraints (read-only root filesystem, capability dropping).

## Orchestration Components

### Agent Registry
Central repository managing agent discovery and capability resolution:

- Maintains manifest of every known agent
- Stores version, persona, capabilities, and status
- Provides lookup for orchestrators and UI components
- Handles dynamic agent registration and deregistration

### Agent Supervisor
Manages agent lifecycle with comprehensive monitoring:

- Loads and isolates agents into secure runtimes
- TTL monitoring and crash auto-restart
- Sandboxes agents based on security profiles
- Enforces resource quotas and policies

### Task Orchestrator
Coordinates complex multi-agent workflows:

- Plans execution strategies for complex goals
- Delegates tasks to appropriate agents
- Monitors progress and handles failures
- Implements retry logic and escalation procedures

## Communication Protocols

### Kind Link Protocol (KLP)

The future system uses KLP for secure agent-to-agent communication with multiple message types:

- `TASK_REQUEST`: Task delegation between agents
- `TASK_RESULT`: Task completion notifications
- `STATUS_UPDATE`: Health and status information
- `CAPABILITY_QUERY`: Capability discovery requests
- `SECURITY_ALERT`: Security event notifications

### Message Structure

```json
{
  "type": "TASK_REQUEST",
  "from": "kPlanner:research",
  "to": "kExecutor:webscraper",
  "task_id": "abc123",
  "payload": {
    "action": "scrape",
    "target": "https://example.com",
    "params": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-06-20T22:04:00Z",
  "auth": {
    "signature": "ed25519:...",
    "token": "..."
  }
}
```

## Security and Trust Framework

### Agent Authentication
- Mutual agent identity via Ed25519/RSA keys
- Role-based access control enforced by kSentinel
- Trust scoring and reputation management
- Capability-based authorization

### Sandbox Security
- Filesystem sandboxing with restricted write access
- Secrets injection via read-only vault mounts
- Network isolation with internal mesh communication
- Resource quotas and capability dropping

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete lifecycle event logging
- Message history capture with trace flags
- Security event monitoring and alerting
- Compliance reporting and forensic analysis

## Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Modes

1. **Local Deployment**: Browser extension or localhost runtime
2. **Containerized Deployment**: Docker/Podman with volume mounts
3. **Distributed Mesh**: Reticulum mesh with peer discovery
4. **Cloud Deployment**: Kubernetes clusters with high availability

### Orchestration Deployment

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  orchestrator:
    image: kos/agent-orchestrator:latest
    ports: [8080]
    volumes:
      - ./orchestrator/config:/config

    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - AGENT_CONFIG=/agent/config.yaml
    networks:
      - klp-mesh
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Monitoring
