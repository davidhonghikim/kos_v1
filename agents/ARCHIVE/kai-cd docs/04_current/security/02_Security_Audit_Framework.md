# Security Audit and Compliance Framework

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: Complete security audit and compliance architecture for validating security implementations. Use this when conducting security audits, implementing compliance measures, or validating cryptographic implementations. Critical document for all security validation work.

**Implementation Notes**: Contains comprehensive audit procedures, compliance frameworks, and security testing methodologies. Covers current audit processes and future automated agent trust verification systems.
**Quality Requirements**: Maintain technical accuracy for all audit procedures and compliance requirements. Keep security testing methodologies current with best practices.
**Integration Points**: Foundation for security validation, links to security framework, governance, and testing documentation.

## Quick Summary
This document provides the complete security audit and compliance architecture, covering the evolution from current security practices to sophisticated agent trust verification, behavioral auditing, and distributed security validation systems.

## Current Implementation (Kai-CD)

### Security Audit Infrastructure
The current system employs foundational security practices with manual validation:

**Current Security Stack:**
- **Cryptographic Utilities**: AES-256-GCM encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Secure Storage**: Chrome storage with encryption for sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: Basic sanitization for user inputs
- **Authentication**: API key management through secure vault
- **Privacy Protection**: Local-first architecture with optional cloud sync

**Security Components:**
```typescript
// Current security implementation
const securityComponents = {
  encryption: {
    algorithm: 'AES-256-GCM',
    keyDerivation: 'PBKDF2',
    saltGeneration: 'crypto.getRandomValues',
    ivGeneration: 'crypto.getRandomValues'
  },
  
  storage: {
    vault: 'Encrypted credential storage',
    preferences: 'Secure user settings storage',
    sessions: 'Temporary session data encryption'
  },
  
  validation: {
    inputSanitization: 'XSS prevention',
    apiKeyValidation: 'Service credential verification',
    configValidation: 'Configuration schema validation'
  }
};
```

### Current Audit Process
The current audit process focuses on manual verification and build-time security checks:

**Security Audit Checklist:**
1. **Cryptographic Security**: Verify AES-256-GCM implementation and key management
2. **Data Protection**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
3. **Access Control**: Validate authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. **Input Validation**: Check for XSS and injection prevention
5. **Storage Security**: Verify secure storage implementation
6. **Communication Security**: Ensure HTTPS for all external communications

## Evolution to Future kOS

### Agent Security Audit Pipeline
The future system will implement comprehensive automated security auditing:

**Pre-Deployment Audit:**
- Identity verification and cryptographic signature validation
- Static code security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Behavioral fingerprinting and baseline establishment
- Trust chain validation and peer endorsement verification
- Capability verification and boundary testing

**Runtime Audit:**
- Continuous behavioral monitoring and anomaly detection
- Real-time trust score tracking and adjustment
- Compliance monitoring and violation detection
- Security event detection and alerting
- Resource usage monitoring and constraint enforcement

**Post-Execution Audit:**
- Audit trail validation and integrity verification
- Outcome verification and result validation
- Trust score updates based on behavior
- Compliance reporting and documentation
- Forensic analysis and incident investigation

### Trust-Based Security Framework
The future security framework will be built on trust verification:

**Agent Trust Verification:**
- **Authenticated Signature (30%)**: Cryptographic identity validation
- **Audit Trail Completeness (20%)**: Complete action logging
- **Peer Endorsements (20%)**: Community trust validation
- **Compliance Tests (15%)**: Security compliance verification
- **Behavioral Consistency (15%)**: Behavior baseline matching

**Trust Levels:**
- **System Core (95%+)**: Full system access with hardware binding
- **Trusted Agent (80%+)**: External API access and vault operations
- **Semi-Trusted (60%+)**: Limited access with audit requirements
- **Untrusted (30%+)**: Sandboxed execution only

## Security Audit Methodologies

**Monitoring Scope:**
- Prompt mutation rate and injection detection
