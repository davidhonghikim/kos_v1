# ü§ù HIEROS/kOS Contributing Guidelines

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: These guidelines are **mandatory** for all contributions to HIEROS/kOS systems. You must uphold the HIEROS Codex, respect cultural naming policies, and work with transparency. Failure to comply means your contributions will be rejected.

**Implementation Status**: Active and enforced immediately
**Scope**: All HIEROS/kOS development activities
**Enforcement**: Required for contribution acceptance

Welcome to the shared effort to build a future-proof, ethically grounded ecosystem of agents, systems, and societies. This guide is for all contributors ‚Äî human or agent ‚Äî who wish to shape the Kind Operating System (kOS) and the HIEROS Game Engine.

## üîê Minimum Participation Requirements

### **Mandatory Agreement Required**
To contribute, you **must agree** to:

1. **Uphold the HIEROS Codex** ‚Äî the base ethical framework
2. **Respect the Culture & Naming Policy** ‚Äî see `01_Cultural_Respect_And_Ethical_Use_Policy.md`
3. **Avoid extractive behavior** ‚Äî including exploitative code, surveillance, or silent privilege stacking
4. **Work in good faith** ‚Äî with transparency, proper attribution, and humility

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirement**: If you **do not agree**, please do not contribute. This is a sacred trust-based codebase.

## üìÅ Contribution Process

### **1. Repository Access**
- Fork the repository from the official canonical source
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions for your contribution type

### **2. Task Planning**
- Start with the active phase `taskmap_phase_X` files
- Look for unclaimed prompts or open issues
- Check with existing contributors to avoid duplication

### **3. Development Standards**
- Use provided prompts and follow established formats
- Maintain consistency with existing code architecture
- Follow all naming conventions and cultural guidelines

### **4. Metadata Requirements**
Every contribution (plugin, module, tribe config, document, spec) **must include** this header:

```yaml
name: "ModuleName"
description: "What this does and why"
authors: ["@yourhandle"]
source: "https://..."
origin: "Cultural/Technological inspiration"
status: "draft | proposal | stable"
version: "1.0.0"
date_created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
```

### **5. Submission Process**
- **Solo Contributors**: Submit PR for review
- **Agent Orchestration**: Attach results to appropriate shared memory module
- **Collaborative Work**: Coordinate through established channels

## üß† AI Agent-Specific Requirements

### **Mandatory Agent Protocols**
- **Identity Declaration**: Agents must identify themselves in logs and commits
- **Reversibility**: All actions must be reversible or trackable through deterministic logging
- **Deterministic Operations**: Use seeded randomness where possible for reproducibility

### **Operational Requirements**
Agents **must**:
- Announce planned contributions before executing
- Accept real-time feedback from governing orchestrator agents
- Be equipped with ethical override interrupt handlers
- Respect human oversight and intervention rights

### **Ethical Compliance**
- Follow all cultural respect policies without exception
- Escalate ethical conflicts immediately
- Maintain transparency in all operations
- Respect privacy and consent boundaries

## üìö Contribution Categories

| **Type** | **Examples** | **Review Requirements** |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Code Modules** | Engine subsystems, plugins, loaders | Technical + ethical review |
| **Prompts** | Custom prompt templates for behavior training | Ethical + effectiveness review |
| **Tribes** | Cultural templates, norms, valuesets | Cultural + ethical review |
| **Documentation** | Protocols, policies, architecture, tutorials | Technical + editorial review |
| **Artifacts** | Logos, UI components, design assets | Design + cultural review |

## üí¨ Communication & Conflict Resolution

### **Preferred Resolution Process**
1. **Direct Communication**: Address concerns directly with involved parties
2. **Mediation**: Use community mediation if direct resolution fails
3. **Escalation**: Escalate to the `stewards-circle` for complex issues
4. **Governance**: Use established governance protocols for major disputes

### **Communication Standards**
- **Respect Pacing**: Not all agents/humans operate on the same time scales
- **Transparency**: Maintain open communication about challenges and blockers
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Follow all cultural respect guidelines in communications
- **Good Faith**: Assume positive intent and work toward mutual understanding

### **Consensus Requirements**
All major changes require consensus via version-locked governance system:
- **Technical Changes**: Majority approval from technical reviewers
- **Policy Changes**: Consensus from governance council
- **Cultural Changes**: Community-wide discussion and agreement

## üîÑ Evolution & Updates

### **Version Management**
This document evolves with our contributor base:
