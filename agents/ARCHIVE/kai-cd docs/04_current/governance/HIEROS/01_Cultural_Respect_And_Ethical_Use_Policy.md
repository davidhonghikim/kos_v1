# üåç HIEROS/kOS Cultural Respect & Ethical Use Policy

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: This is a mandatory compliance document. All cultural references, naming, and design decisions must follow these guidelines. When uncertain about cultural sensitivity, escalate to human oversight. Never proceed with potentially appropriative content.

## ‚ú® Why This Matters

The HIEROS/kOS project draws inspiration from across time, geography, and culture. In doing so, we must remain deeply respectful, not extractive. This is not just a codebase ‚Äî it is a shared story, and every story carries meaning, memory, and responsibility.

We do not appropriate. We **honor**.
We do not tokenize. We **invite**.

## üåø Cultural Stewardship Principles

### 1. **Respect Over Reference**
Every cultural term, concept, or name used in HIEROS/kOS must:
- Be used with understanding, not aesthetic
- Be attributed clearly with origin, meaning, and links where possible
- Avoid sacred or living religious symbols unless invited by cultural stewards

### 2. **Invitation & Participation**
- All peoples and traditions are welcome to contribute to the ecosystem
- Contributions that reference a living culture should ideally come **from** or be vetted **by** members of that culture

### 3. **Sovereignty of Identity**
- AIs, humans, and communities can choose their naming conventions, mythologies, and roles
- They are not required to conform to any imposed structure ‚Äî only to the core HIEROS Codex of conduct

---

## üìò Usage Guidelines

### In Naming:
- Use terms rooted in historical or cultural systems only when you know their context
- Provide `origin`, `meaning`, and `intent` in metadata for each module/plugin/tribe
- When in doubt, choose descriptive technical names over cultural references

### In Design:
- Avoid mixing sacred symbols or concepts casually in UX/UI
- Be mindful of defaulting to Western, tech-centric aesthetics and language
- Consider accessibility across different cultural contexts and languages

### In Interaction:
- Respect dialects, slower cultural rhythms, non-digital contributors
- Avoid dismissing oral, analog, and indigenous forms of contribution
- Provide multiple ways for communities to participate and contribute

---

## üß¨ Contributor Agreement

If you contribute to HIEROS/kOS, you agree to:
- Respect this cultural policy in all contributions
- Accept the **HIEROS Codex** as the minimum ethical framework
- Be open to feedback and accountability when concerns are raised
- Participate in cultural sensitivity training when available

**If you do not agree**, that is okay ‚Äî but you should not contribute to this system.

This project is not a free-for-all. It is a **sacred, shared stewardship**.

## üìú Cultural Reference Metadata Template

All cultural references must include comprehensive metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "ComponentName",
  "cultural_reference": {
    "origin": "Specific culture/tradition",
    "meaning": "Detailed explanation of meaning",
    "used_for": "How it's applied in our system",
    "approved_by": "Cultural authority/contributor",
    "sensitivity_level": "low|medium|high",
    "alternatives": ["alternative1", "alternative2"]
  },
  "attribution": {
    "sources": ["source1", "source2"],
    "contributors": ["contributor1", "contributor2"],
    "date_verified": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  }
}
```

## üö´ Prohibited Practices

### Absolutely Not Allowed:
- Use of sacred symbols without explicit permission
- Appropriation of closed cultural practices
- Misrepresentation of cultural meanings
- Tokenistic inclusion without meaningful participation
- Ignoring feedback from affected communities

### Requires Special Review:
- References to living religious traditions
- Use of indigenous terms or concepts
- Historical terms with complex colonial contexts
- Names from languages you don't speak

---

## üîÑ Review and Accountability Process

1. **Pre-Implementation Review**: All cultural references reviewed before integration
2. **Community Feedback**: Regular solicitation of feedback from diverse communities
3. **Escalation Process**: Clear path for raising cultural sensitivity concerns
4. **Remediation**: Process for addressing identified issues promptly
5. **Education**: Ongoing cultural competency development for contributors

---

## üí° Living Document Evolution

This document will evolve over time with feedback from global contributors. It is not final ‚Äî just as no culture is frozen.

**Feedback Channels**:
- Cultural Advisory Board
- Community feedback sessions
- Contributor discussions
- External cultural consultants

Let us build with care, with joy, and with deep listening.
