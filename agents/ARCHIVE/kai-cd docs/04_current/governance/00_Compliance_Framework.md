# Compliance Framework

## Agent Context
**For AI Agents**: Comprehensive compliance framework documentation covering regulatory adherence, security standards, and governance policies for Kai-CD implementation. Use this when implementing compliance measures, ensuring regulatory adherence, understanding governance requirements, or planning compliance strategies. Essential for all compliance-related development work.

**Implementation Notes**: Establishes compliance requirements for current implementation and future evolution. Contains regulatory frameworks, security compliance standards, and governance policies that must be followed throughout system development.
**Quality Requirements**: Maintain strict accuracy of all compliance requirements and regulatory standards. Keep compliance measures synchronized with actual implementation and legal requirements.
**Integration Points**: Foundation for all compliance work, links to security framework, governance policies, and cultural respect guidelines for comprehensive compliance coverage.
