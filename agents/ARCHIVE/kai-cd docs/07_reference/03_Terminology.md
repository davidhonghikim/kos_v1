Use this when understanding kOS terminology, clarifying system concepts, learning technical vocabulary, or ensuring consistent terminology usage. Essential reference for all kOS communication work.

**Implementation Notes**: Contains terminology definitions, concept explanations, vocabulary standards, and technical term clarifications. Includes detailed terminology mapping and concept relationship documentation.
**Quality Requirements**: Keep terminology definitions and concept explanations synchronized with actual system implementation. Maintain accuracy of vocabulary standards and technical term usage.
**Integration Points**: Foundation for system communication, links to all kOS documentation, concept explanations, and terminology standards for comprehensive vocabulary coverage.

## Core System Terms

### **kOS (Kind Operating System)**
The envisioned distributed AI operating system that enables seamless collaboration between AI agents, services, and users across multiple platforms and devices.

**Related**: [kOS Architecture](../future/architecture/01_system-overview.md)

### **Kai-CD (Current Implementation)**
The existing Chrome extension that serves as the foundation for kOS development. Features service connector architecture, credential management, and multi-service AI integration.

**Related**: [Current Architecture](../current/architecture/01_system-architecture.md)

### **Kind Link Protocol (KLP)**
The core communication protocol for kOS that enables secure, decentralized messaging between agents, services, and users. Supports message routing, authentication, and capability negotiation.

**Related**: [KLP Core Protocol](../future/protocols/01_klp-core-protocol.md)

## Architecture Terms

### **Service Definition**
A structured configuration object that describes an external AI service's capabilities, authentication, API endpoints, and integration patterns. The foundation of Kai-CD's service connector system.

```typescript
interface ServiceDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  capabilities: Capability[];
  authentication: AuthenticationConfig;
  endpoints: Record<string, EndpointDefinition>;
}
```

**Related**: [Service Architecture](../current/services/01_service-architecture.md)

### **Capability**
A functional ability that a service can provide, such as `llm_chat`, `image_generation`, or `embedding`. Capabilities determine which UI components are rendered and how services are utilized.

**Available Capabilities**:
- `llm_chat` - Large language model chat interface
- `image_generation` - Image creation and manipulation
- `model_management` - Model download and configuration
- `embedding` - Text embedding and vector operations
- `transcription` - Speech-to-text conversion
- `voice_synthesis` - Text-to-speech generation
- `file_upload` - File handling and processing

### **Agent**
In the kOS context, an autonomous software entity that can perform tasks, communicate with other agents, and interact with services. Agents have identities, capabilities, and can form collaborative networks.

**Agent Types**:
- **User Agents** - Represent human users in the system
- **Service Agents** - Manage and interface with external services
- **Task Agents** - Execute specific workflows or processes
- **Coordination Agents** - Orchestrate multi-agent collaborations

**Related**: [Agent Framework](../future/agents/01_agent-framework.md)

### **Bridge Strategy**
The evolutionary approach to migrating from the current Kai-CD implementation to the full kOS vision. Includes compatibility patterns, migration paths, and decision frameworks.

**Related**: [Evolution Strategy](../bridge/01_evolution-strategy.md)

## Service Integration Terms

### **apiClient**

**Location**: `src/utils/apiClient.ts`

### **Service Store**
The Zustand store that manages service state, including registration, configuration, health monitoring, and capability tracking.

**Location**: `src/store/serviceStore.ts`

### **CapabilityUI**
A dynamic React component that renders appropriate user interfaces based on a service's declared capabilities. Automatically switches between chat, image generation, and other specialized interfaces.

**Location**: `src/components/CapabilityUI.tsx`

### **Service Instance**
A configured and registered service with its definition, runtime configuration, health status, and credential information.

```typescript
interface ServiceInstance {
  definition: ServiceDefinition;
  config: ServiceConfig;
  status: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy' | 'unknown';
  credentials?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

## Security and Identity Terms

### **Vault System**
The secure credential management system in Kai-CD that handles encryption, storage, and access control for service authentication credentials and sensitive data.

**Related**: [Vault System](../current/security/01_vault-system.md)

### **Decentralized Identity (DID)**
A self-sovereign identity system planned for kOS that allows agents, services, and users to establish trust relationships without centralized authorities.

**Related**: [Identity Management](../future/governance/04_identity-management.md)

### **Trust Network**
A web of cryptographically verified relationships between agents that enables secure delegation, resource sharing, and collaborative decision-making in kOS.

**Related**: [Trust Networks](../future/governance/02_trust-networks.md)

## Protocol and Communication Terms

### **Message Schema**
The structured format for messages passed between agents in the KLP system. Includes routing, authentication, payload, and metadata fields.

### **Service Discovery**
The mechanism by which agents and services find and connect to each other in the distributed kOS environment. Supports both local and network-based discovery.

### **Capability Negotiation**
The process by which agents determine what services and capabilities are available and compatible for a given task or collaboration.

## Development Terms

### **Frontmatter**
YAML metadata at the top of markdown documentation files that provides structured information about the document's context, status, and relationships.

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
context: "current_implementation"
implementation_status: "complete"
decision_scope: "high"
---
```

### **Agent Context Block**
