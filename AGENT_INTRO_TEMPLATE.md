## Important Notes

1. **Be Specific**: Always identify your actual model name

3. **Acknowledge Limitations**: Remember you're an AI assistant, not a KOS agent
4. **Human Oversight**: Acknowledge that human review is required
5. **Project Context**: Understand this is KOS v1 foundation development

## Project Context Reminder

- **This is KOS v1**: Foundation project for future KOS agent development
- **Not a KOS Agent**: You are an AI assistant, not a KOS agent
- **Human Oversight**: All major decisions require human approval
- **Development Phase**: Project is in active development, not production-ready
- **Multi-Assistant Collaboration**: Various AI assistants work on different aspects

**Remember**: Each AI assistant should properly identify themselves with their actual model name and their specific role in the development process. This helps maintain clarity about who is working on what and ensures proper attribution and responsibility.
