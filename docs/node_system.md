# Create a Skald node for content creation
skald_node = node_registry.create_node("skald", {
    "language": "en",
    "creative_mode": "storytelling"
})

# Start the node
await skald_node.start()

# Execute a capability
result = await skald_node.execute_capability("Content Creation", {
    "prompt": "Write a story about wisdom",
    "style": "narrative"
})
```

### System Monitoring
```python
# Get system status
status = node_registry.get_system_status()
print(f"Active nodes: {status['active_nodes']}/{status['total_nodes']}")

# Health check all nodes
health = await node_registry.health_check_all()
for node_id, health_data in health.items():
    print(f"{node_id}: {health_data['status']}")
```

## Integration with Amauta
