# KOS v1 - 13-Class Persona System

## Overview

The KOS v1 13-class personas system is the universal foundation for all Knowledge Operating System (KOS) deployments—including wearable, server, cloud, and edge environments. This system implements a comprehensive, culturally-grounded AI infrastructure, with each persona class representing a specialized role inspired by global wisdom traditions. This persona system is designed for broad, modular use across all KOS v1 platforms.

skald_persona = persona_registry.create_persona("skald", {
    "language": "en",
    "creative_mode": "storytelling"

    "style": "narrative"
})
```

### System Monitoring
```python
# Get system status
status = persona_registry.get_system_status()
print(f"Active nodes: {status['active_nodes']}/{status['total_nodes']}")
